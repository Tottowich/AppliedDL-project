abstract = {The first step in the encounter between a host and a pathogen is attachment to the host epithelium. For uropathogenic Escherichia coli, these interactions are mediated by type 1 and P adhesive pili, which are long (approximately 1 microm) rods composed of more than 1000 protein subunits arranged in a helical structure. Here we used single-molecule atomic force microscopy to study the mechanical properties of type 1 pili. We found that type 1 pili readily extend under an applied force and that this extensibility is the result of unwinding the pilus rod's helical quaternary structure. The forced unraveling is also reversible, with helical rewinding taking place under considerable forces (approximately 60 pN). These data are similar to those obtained on P pili using optical tweezers, indicating that these are conserved properties of uropathogenic E. coli pili. We also show that our data can readily be reproduced using Monte Carlo simulation techniques based on a two-state kinetic model. This model provides a simple way to extrapolate the mechanical behavior of pili under a wide range of forces. We propose that type 1 pilus unraveling is an essential mechanism for absorbing physiological shear forces encountered during urinary tract infections and probably essential for adhesion and colonization of the bladder epithelium.},

@article{Polikanov2007,
abstract = {Numerous biological processes are regulated by DNA elements that communicate with their targets over a distance via formation of protein-bridged DNA loops. One of the first questions arising in studies of DNA looping is whether the rate of loop formation is limited by diffusion of the DNA sites. We addressed this question by comparing the in vitro measured rates of transcription initiation in the NtrC-glnAp2 enhancer-dependent transcription initiation system with predictions of two different theoretical models. The promoter and enhancer were in a 7.6-kb plasmid and separated by 2.5 kb. The measurements were performed for different values of the plasmid superhelix density, from 0 to -0.07. Earlier theoretical analysis, based on the Monte Carlo simulation of DNA conformations, showed that if the rate of loop formation is determined by the equilibrium probability of juxtaposition of the DNA sites, the rate should be approximately 100 times higher in supercoiled than in relaxed DNA. On the other hand, Brownian dynamics simulation showed that if the rate of loop formation is limited by the site diffusion, it should be nearly independent of DNA supercoiling. We found that efficiency of the transcription initiation increases by nearly two orders of magnitude as a result of the corresponding increase of the template supercoiling. This clearly shows that the rate of bridging in the enhancer-promoter system is not limited by diffusion of the DNA sites to one another. We argue that this conclusion derived for the specific system is likely to be valid for the great majority of biological processes involving protein-mediated DNA looping.},

Here, alternative biological roles for this process are presented and discussed, incorporating recent studies on nonpathogenic and commensal bacterial species. Furthermore, the integration of phase variation into bacterial regulatory networks and the relevance of this for considering phase variation as a random process are reviewed. Novel approaches are needed to study phase variation and its biological roles, but the insights obtained can contribute significantly to our understanding of the dynamic behaviour of bacterial populations and their interactions with the environment.},

abstract = {A novel numerical simulation of adhesive particles (cells) reversibly interacting with an adhesive surface under flow is presented. Particle--particle and particle--wall hydrodynamic interactions in low Reynolds number Couette flow are calculated using a boundary element method that solves an integral representation of the Stokes equation. Molecular bonds between surfaces are modeled as linear springs and stochastically formed and broken according to postulated descriptions of force-dependent kinetics. The resulting simulation, Multiparticle Adhesive Dynamics, is applied to the problem of selectin-mediated rolling of hard spheres coated with leukocyte adhesion molecules (cell-free system). Simulation results are compared to flow chamber experiments performed with carbohydrate-coated spherical beads rolling on P-selectin. Good agreement is found between theory and experiment, with the main observation being a decrease in rolling velocity with increasing concentration of rolling cells or increasing proximity between rolling cells. Pause times are found to increase and deviation motion is found to decrease as pairs of rolling cells become closer together or align with the flow.},

@article{Koster2003,
abstract = {The tubular morphology of intracellular membranous compartments is actively maintained through interactions with motor proteins and the cytoskeleton. Moving along cytoskeletal elements, motor proteins exert forces on the membranes to which they are attached, resulting in the formation of membrane tubes and tubular networks. To study the formation of membrane tubes by motor proteins, we developed an in vitro assay consisting of purified kinesin proteins directly linked to the lipids of giant unilamellar vesicles. When the vesicles are brought into contact with a network of immobilized microtubules, membrane tubes and tubular networks are formed. Through systematic variation of the kinesin concentration and membrane composition we study the mechanism involved. We show that a threshold concentration of motor proteins is needed and that a low membrane tension facilitates tube formation. Forces involved in tube formation were measured directly with optical tweezers and are shown to depend only on the tension and bending rigidity of the membrane. The forces were found to be higher than can be generated by individual motor proteins, indicating that multiple motors were working together to pull tubes. We propose a simple mechanism by which individual motor proteins can dynamically associate into clusters that provide the force needed for the formation of tubes, explaining why, in contrast to earlier findings [Roux, A., Cappello, G., Cartaud, J., Prost, J., Goud, B. {\&} Bassereau, P. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 5394-5399], motor proteins do not need to be physically linked to each other to be able to pull tubes.},

abstract = {Contraction of Vortlcella convallaria, a sessile ciliated protozoan, is completed within a few milliseconds and results in a retraction of its cell body toward the substratum by coiling its stalk. Previous studies have modeled the cell body as a sphere and assumed a drag force that satisfies Stokes' law. However, the contraction-induced flow of the medium is transient and bounded by the substrate, and the maximum Reynolds number is larger than unity. Thus, calculations of contractile force from the drag force are incomplete. In this study, we analyzed fluid flow during contraction by the particle tracking velocimetry and computational fluid dynamics simulations to estimate the contractile force. Particle paths show that the induced flow is limited by the substrate. Simulation-based force estimates suggest that the combined effect of the flow unsteadiness, the finite Reynolds number, and the substrate comprises 35{\%} of the total force. The work done in the early stage of contraction and the maximum power output are similar regardless of the medium viscosity. These results suggest that, during the initial development of force, V. convallaria uses a common mechanism for performing mechanical work irrespective of viscous loading conditions. ?? 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The chaperone-usher pathway directs the formation of adhesive surface fibres in numerous pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. The fibres or pili consist exclusively of protein subunits that, before assembly, form transient complexes with a chaperone in the periplasm. In these chaperone:subunit complexes, the chaperone donates one beta-strand to complete the imperfect immunoglobulin-like fold of the subunit. During pilus assembly, the chaperone is replaced by a polypeptide extension of another subunit in a process termed 'donor strand exchange' (DSE). Here we show that DSE occurs in a concerted reaction in which a chaperone-bound acceptor subunit is attacked by another chaperone-bound donor subunit. We provide evidence that efficient DSE requires interactions between the reacting subunits in addition to those involving the attacking donor strand. Our results indicate that the pilus assembly platforms in the outer membrane, referred to as ushers, catalyse fibre formation by increasing the effective concentrations of donor and acceptor subunits.},

abstract = {Various native and hinge-modified forms of Ig with identical Ids were reacted with an anti-Id mAb, and the resultant immune complexes were analyzed by negative stain immunoelectron microscopy. Complexes were scored for their geometry (linear versus ring complexes) and size (dimer, trimer, etc.). Ring dimers are the thermodynamically most favorable configuration, unless inhibited by steric and/or flexibility constraints. We found ring dimerization to correlate with the length of the upper, but not middle or lower, hinge. In contrast, the geometry and size of complexes of those molecules lacking formal hinges were unpredictable. A hingeless IgG mutant and native IgE readily formed ring dimers. Remarkably, monomeric IgM formed more ring dimers than any of the other Igs tested, including IgG3. We also tagged the Fab arms and measured the mean Fab-Fab angles and the degree of angular variation for each type of Ig. Surprisingly, IgM proved the most flexible by this assay. In hinged Igs, there was a correlation between length of the upper hinge and Fab-Fab flexibility. In contrast, we found no correlation between the mean Fab-Fab angle in uncomplexed Igs and their ability to dimerize with anti-Id mAb. These data suggest that the physicochemical methods typically used to evaluate molecular flexibility are often of low predictive value when tested in a functional assay.},

abstract = {The deformation behavior of certain biologic macromolecules is modeled by the "sticky chain," a freely jointed chain with weak bonds between subsequent joints. Straining the chain leads to thermally assisted breaking of the weak bonds, yielding a characteristic shape of the force-elongation curve, usually with a pronounced plateau, but sometimes displaying a pseudo-Hookean behavior over a wide range of deformations. The number of individual links is assumed to be large, so the stochastic time evolution of the individual events can be approximated by a differential equation. The cases of individual and collective bond breaking are treated and formulae given for various measurable quantities. A threshold strain rate is found, below which the deformation force no longer depends on the deformation velocity. The method is applied to experimental results for the deformation of single molecules like titin or DNA and the results agree with the parameters deduced from the same experiments by the original authors using Monte Carlo (MC) calculations. Despite its intrinsic continuous character, the model, therefore, is applicable even for the deformation of macromolecules with only a few discrete unfolding elements, yielding physical quantities from experimental results using simple formulae instead of a host of MC computations.},

abstract = {FimH is the adhesive subunit of type 1 fimbriae of the Escherichia coli that is composed of a mannose-binding lectin domain and a fimbria-incorporating pilin domain. FimH is able to interact with mannosylated surface via a shear-enhanced catch bond mechanism. We show that the FimH lectin domain possesses a ligand-induced binding site (LIBS), a type of allosterically regulated epitopes characterized in integrins. Analogous to integrins, in FimH the LIBS epitope becomes exposed in the presence of the ligand (or "activating" mutations) and is located far from the ligand-binding site, close to the interdomain interface. Also, the antibody binding to the LIBS shifts adhesin from the low to high affinity state. Binding of streptavidin to the biotinylated residue within the LIBS also locks FimH in the high affinity state, suggesting that the allosteric perturbations in FimH are sustained by the interdomain wedging. In the presence of antibodies, the strength of bacterial adhesion to mannose is increased similar to the increase observed under shear force, suggesting the same allosteric mechanism, a shift in the interdomain configuration. Thus, an integrin-like allosteric link between the binding pocket and the interdomain conformation can serve as the basis for the catch bond property of FimH and, possibly, other adhesive proteins.},

abstract = {Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) bacteria are commensals in the human nasopharynx, as well as pathogens associated with a spectrum of acute and chronic infections. Two important factors that influence NTHI pathogenicity are their ability to adhere to human tissue and their ability to form biofilms. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and bacterial appendages such as pili critically influence cell adhesion and intercellular cohesion during biofilm formation. Structural components in the outer cell membrane, such as lipopolysaccharides, also play a fundamental role in infection of the host organism. In spite of their importance, these pathogenic factors are not yet well characterized at the nanoscale. Here, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used in aqueous environments to visualize structural details, including probable Hif-type pili, of live NTHI bacteria at the early stages of biofilm formation. Using single-molecule AFM-based spectroscopy, the molecular elasticities of lipooligosaccharides present on NTHI cell surfaces were analyzed and compared between two strains (PittEE and PittGG) with very different pathogenicity profiles. Furthermore, the stiffness of single cells of both strains was measured and subsequently their turgor pressure was estimated.},

@article{Mortezaei2015a,
abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are a major cause of diarrhea worldwide, and infection of children in underdeveloped countries often leads to high mortality rates. Isolated ETEC express a plethora of colonization factors (fimbriae/pili), of which CFA/I and CFA/II that are assembled via the alternate chaperone pathway (ACP), are amongst the most common. Fimbriae are filamentous structures, whose shafts are primarily composed of helically arranged single pilin-protein subunits, with a unique biomechanical capability allowing them to unwind and rewind. A sustained ETEC infection, under adverse conditions of dynamic shear forces, is primarily attributed to this biomechanical feature of ETEC fimbriae. Recent understandings about the role of fimbriae as virulence factors are pointing to an evolutionary adaptation of their structural and biomechanical features. In this work, we investigated the biophysical properties of CS2 fimbriae from the CFA/II group. Homology modelling its major structural subunit CotA reveals structural clues and these are related to the niche in which they are expressed. Using optical tweezers force spectroscopy we found that CS2 fimbriae unwind at a constant force of 10 pN and have a corner velocity of 1300 nm/s, i.e., the velocity at which the force required for unwinding rises exponentially with increased speed. The biophysical properties of CS2 fimbriae assessed in this work classify them into a low-force unwinding group of fimbriae together with the CFA/I and CS20 fimbriae expressed by ETEC strains. The three fimbriae are expressed by ETEC, colonize in similar gut environments, and exhibit similar biophysical features, but differ in their biogenesis. Our observation suggests that the environment has a strong impact on the biophysical characteristics of fimbriae expressed by ETEC.},

abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) has been used to measure the strength of bonds between biological receptor molecules and their ligands. But for weak noncovalent bonds, a dynamic spectrum of bond strengths is predicted as the loading rate is altered, with the measured strength being governed by the prominent barriers traversed in the energy landscape along the force-driven bond-dissociation pathway. In other words, the pioneering early AFM measurements represent only a single point in a continuous spectrum of bond strengths, because theory predicts that these will depend on the rate at which the load is applied. Here we report the strength spectra for the bonds between streptavidin (or avidin) and biotins-the prototype of receptor-ligand interactions used in earlier AFM studies, and which have been modelled by molecular dynamics. We have probed bond formation over six orders of magnitude in loading rate, and find that the bond survival time diminished from about 1 min to 0.001 s with increasing loading rate over this range. The bond strength, meanwhile, increased from about 5 pN to 170 pN. Thus, although they are among the strongest noncovalent linkages in biology (affinity of 10(13) to 10(15) M(-1)), these bonds in fact appear strong or weak depending on how fast they are loaded. We are also able to relate the activation barriers derived from our strength spectra to the shape of the energy landscape derived from simulations of the biotin-avidin complex.},

We report here the use of infrared (IR) light to make much improved laser traps with significantly less optical damage to a variety of living cells. Using IR light we have observed the reproduction of Escherichia coli within optical traps at power levels sufficient to give manipulation at velocities up to approximately 500 micron s-1. Reproduction of yeast cells by budding was also achieved in IR traps capable of manipulating individual cells and clumps of cells at velocities of approximately micron s-1. Damage-free trapping and manipulation of suspensions of red blood cells of humans and of organelles located within individual living cells of spirogyra was also achieved, largely as a result of the reduced absorption of haemoglobin and chlorophyll in the IR. Trapping of many types of small protozoa and manipulation of organelles within protozoa is also possible. The manipulative capabilities of optical techniques were exploited in experiments showing separation of individual bacteria from one sample and their introduction into another sample. Optical orientation of individual bacterial cells in space was also achieved using a pair of laser-beam traps. These new manipulative techniques using IR light are capable of producing large forces under damage-free conditions and improve the prospects for wider use of optical manipulation techniques in microbiology.},

abstract = {The receptor-mediated adhesion of cells to ligand-coated surfaces in viscous shear flow is an important step in many physiological processes, such as the neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response, lymphocyte homing, and tumor cell metastasis. This paper describes a calculational method which simulates the interaction of a single cell with a ligand-coated surface under flow. The cell is idealized as a microvilli-coated hard sphere covered with adhesive springs. The distribution of microvilli on the cell surface, the distribution of receptors on microvilli tips, and the forward and reverse reaction between receptor and ligand are all simulated using random number sampling of appropriate probability functions. The velocity of the cell at each time step in the simulation results from a balance of hydrodynamic, colloidal and bonding forces; the bonding force is derived by summing the individual contributions of each receptor-ligand tether. The model can simulate the effect of many parameters on adhesion, such as the number of receptors on microvilli tips, the density of ligand, the rates of reaction between receptor and ligand, the stiffness of the resulting receptor-ligand springs, the response of springs to strain, and the magnitude of the bulk hydrodynamic stresses. The model can successfully recreate the entire range of expected and observed adhesive phenomena, from completely unencumbered motion, to rolling, to transient attachment, to firm adhesion. Also, the method can generate meaningful statistical measures of adhesion, including the mean and variance in velocity, rate constants for cell attachment and detachment, and the frequency of adhesion. We find a critical modulating parameter of adhesion is the fractional spring slippage, which relates the strain of a bond to its rate of breakage; the higher the slippage, the faster the breakage for the same strain. Our analysis of neutrophil adhesive behavior on selectin-coated (CD62-coated) surfaces in viscous shear flow reported by Lawrence and Springer (Lawrence, M.B., and T.A. Springer 1991. Cell. 65:859-874) shows the fractional spring slippage of the CD62-LECAM-1 bond is likely below 0.01. We conclude the unique ability of this selectin bond to cause neutrophil rolling under flow is a result of its unique response to strain. Furthermore, our model can successfully recreate data on neutrophil rolling as function of CD62 surface density.},

Here we demonstrate a physical technique that allows gene trafficking to be studied at the single-gene level by combining sensitive fluorescence microscopy with microinjection. As a model system, we investigate the nuclear import of influenza genes, in the form of ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs), by imaging single vRNPs in living cells in real time. Our single-particle trajectories show that vRNPs are transported to the nuclear envelope by diffusion. We have observed heterogeneous interactions between the vRNPs and nuclear pore complexes with dissociation rate constants spanning two orders of magnitude. Our single-particle tracking experiments also provided new insights into the regulation mechanisms for the nuclear import of vRNPs: the influenza M1 protein, a regulatory protein for the import process, downregulates the nuclear import of vRNPs by inhibiting the interactions between vRNPs and nuclear pore complexes but has no significant effect on the transport properties of vRNPs. We expect this single-particle tracking approach to find broad application in investigations of genetic trafficking.},

abstract = {A major puzzle in biology is how mammalian sperm maintain the correct swimming direction during various phases of the sexual reproduction process. Whilst chemotaxis may dominate near the ovum, it is unclear which cues guide spermatozoa on their long journey towards the egg. Hypothesized mechanisms range from peristaltic pumping to temperature sensing and response to fluid flow variations (rheotaxis), but little is known quantitatively about them. We report the first quantitative study of mammalian sperm rheotaxis, using microfluidic devices to investigate systematically swimming of human and bull sperm over a range of physiologically relevant shear rates and viscosities. Our measurements show that the interplay of fluid shear, steric surface-interactions, and chirality of the flagellar beat leads to stable upstream spiralling motion of sperm cells, thus providing a generic and robust rectification mechanism to support mammalian fertilisation. A minimal mathematical model is presented that accounts quantitatively for the experimental observations.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02403.001.},

abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is recognized as the main cause of bacterial diarrhoea among children in Asia, Africa and Latin America but less investigated in Bolivia. Objective: To determine the relation between enterotoxins, CFs and serotypes as well as the antimicrobial resistance patterns in a set of ETEC isolates collected from hospitalized children with acute diarrhea. In the present study we characterized 43 ETEC strains isolated from 2002 to 2006 from hospitalized children (0-5 years) with acute diarrhea in Bolivia. The strains were analyzed for heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins and colonization factor (CF) profiles, as well as for serogroups and antimicrobial resistance using phenotypic (ELISA, dot blot, slide agglutination and disc difusion) and genotypic (Multiplex PCR) methods. Among the ETEC isolates tested, 30 were positive for LT, 3 for ST and 10 for LT/ST. Sixty-five percent (28/43) of the strains expressed one or more CF. The most common CFs were CS17 (n = 8) and CFA/I (n = 8). The phenotypical and genotypical results for toxins and CFs were congruent except for CS21 that was amplifed in 10 of the strains by multiplex PCR, but CS21 pili was only detected phenotypically in four of these strains. The ETEC strains had diverse O and H antigens and the most common types were O8:H9 LT CS17 (n = 6; 14{\%}) and O78:HNM LT-ST CFA/I (n = 4; 9{\%}). The analysis of antibiotic resistance showed that 67{\%} (n = 29/43) of the strains were resistant to one or several of the antimicrobial agents tested. Presence of CFs was associated with antibiotic resistance. Conclusion: The most common toxin profile was LT 70{\%}, LT/ST 23{\%} and ST 7{\%}. High antimicrobial resistance to ampicillin among serogroups O6, O8 and O78 were the most common. © Elsevier Editora Ltda.},

abstract = {Pathogenic Escherichia coli strains commonly harbor genes involved in formation of fimbriae, such as the sfa(II) fimbrial gene cluster found in uropathogenic and newborn meningitis isolates. The sfaX(II) gene, located at the distal end of the sfa(II) operon, was recently shown to play a role in controlling virulence-related gene expression in extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Until now, detailed characterization of the SfaX(II) protein has been hampered by difficulties in obtaining large quantities of soluble protein. By a rational modeling approach, we engineered a Cys70Ser mutation, which successfully improved solubility of the protein. Here, we present the expression, purification, and initial characterization of the recombinant SfaX(IIC70S) mutant. The protein was produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells grown in autoinduction culture media. The plasmid vector harbored DNA encoding the SfaX(IIC70S) protein N-terminally fused with a six histidine (H6) sequence followed by a ZZ tag (a derivative of the Staphylococcus protein A) (H6-ZZ tag). The H6-ZZ tag was cleaved off with Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease and the 166 amino acid full-length homo-dimeric protein was purified using affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays and atomic force microscopy demonstrated that the protein possesses DNA-binding properties, suggesting that the transcriptional regulatory activity of SfaX(II) can be mediated via direct binding to DNA.},

abstract = {High-resolution long-time force measurements by optical tweezers are often limited by low-frequency (1/f) noise. A dual-trap technique is presented that can reduce such noise in the force signal. It incorporates a second trap (a reference trap) that probes the noise in the system and it is based upon the assumption that the low-frequency parts of the noise from the two traps are correlated. A subtraction of the low-frequency signal from the reference trap from the signal from the force measuring trap will therefore yield a net signal that is significantly less influenced by noise. It is shown that this dual-trap technique can reduce the noise in the force signal up to 60{\%} depending on detection bandwidth.},

The goal of our study was to visualize the morphology of CS3 and CS6 fimbriae in wild-type and recombinant E. coli strains by means of transmission electron microscopy in conjunction with negative staining and immunolabeling. Corresponding ETEC genes were cloned into E. coli K12 strain DH10B. Expression of fimbriae was dependent on culture conditions and sample handling. Specific immunolabeling of fimbriae unequivocally demonstrated the presence of all types of surface antigens investigated. Negative staining was effective in revealing CS3 but not CS6. In addition, this technique clearly demonstrated differences in the morphology of genetically and immunologically identical CS3 surface antigens in wild-type and recombinant strains.

abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important cause of diarrheal disease and deaths among children in developing countries and the major cause of traveller's diarrhea. Since surface protein colonization factors (CFs) of ETEC are important for pathogenicity and immune protection is mainly mediated by locally produced IgA antibodies in the gut, much effort has focused on the development of an oral CF-based vaccine. We have recently described the development of recombinant strains over-expressing CFA/I; the most prevalent CF among human clinical ETEC isolates. Here, non-toxigenic recombinant E. coli strains over-expressing Coli surface antigen 2 (CS2), CS4, CS5, and CS6, either alone, or each in combination with CFA/I were constructed by cloning the genes required for expression and assembly of each CF into expression vectors harboring a strong promoter. Immunological assays showed that recombinant strains expressing single CFs produced those in significantly larger amounts than did corresponding naturally high producing reference strains. Recombinant strains co-expressing CFA/I together with another CF also expressed significantly larger amounts of both CFs compared with the corresponding references strains. Further, when tested in mice, oral immunization with formalin-killed recombinant bacteria co-expressing one such double-expression CF pair, CFA/I. +. CS2, induced specific serum IgG. +. IgM and fecal IgA antibody responses against both CFs exceeding the responses induced by immunizations with natural reference strains expressing CFA/I and CS2, respectively. We conclude that the described type of recombinant bacteria over-expressing major CFs of ETEC, alone or in combination, may be useful as candidate strains for use in an oral whole-cell CF-ETEC vaccine. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

It has recently been shown, using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, that plasmid DNA exhibits unexpected acceleration of its internal diffusive motion upon supercoiling to intermediate density. Here, we present an independent study that shows a similar acceleration for fully supercoiled plasmid DNA. We have developed a method that allows fluorescent labeling of a 200-bp region, as well as efficient supercoiling by Escherichia coli gyrase. Compared to plain circular or linear DNA, the submicrosecond motion within the supercoiled molecules appears faster by up to an order of magnitude. The mean-square displacement as a function of time reveals an additional intermediate regime with a lowered scaling exponent compared to that of circular DNA. Although this unexpected behavior is not fully understood, it could be explained by conformational constraints of the DNA strand within the supercoiled topology in combination with an increased apparent persistence length.},

abstract = {Thermal motions in supercoiled DNA are studied by Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations with a focus on the site juxtaposition process. It had been shown in the last decade that the BD approach is capable of describing actual times of large-scale DNA motion. The bead model of DNA used here accounts for bending and torsional elasticity as well as the electrostatic repulsion among DNA segments. The hydrodynamic interaction among the beads of the model chain and the aqueous solution is incorporated through the Rotne-Prager tensor. All simulations were performed for the sodium ion concentration of 0.01 M. We first showed, to test our BD procedure, that the same distributions of equilibrium conformational properties are obtained as by Monte Carlo simulations for the corresponding DNA model. The BD simulations also predict with accuracy published experimental values of the diffusion coefficients of supercoiled DNA. To describe the rate of conformational changes, we also calculated the autocorrelation functions for the writhe and radius of gyration for the supercoiled molecules. The rate of site juxtaposition was then studied for DNA molecules up to 3000 bp in length. We find that site juxtaposition is a very slow process: although accelerated by a factor of more than 100 by DNA supercoiling, the times of juxtaposition are in the range of ms even for highly supercoiled DNA, about two orders of magnitude higher than the relaxation times of writhe and the radius of gyration for the same molecules. By inspecting successive simulated conformations of supercoiled DNA, we conclude that slithering of opposing segments of the interwound superhelix is not an efficient mechanism to accomplish site juxtaposition, at least for conditions of low salt concentration. Instead, transient distortions of the interwound superhelix, followed by continuous reshaping of the molecule, contribute more significantly to site juxtaposition kinetics.},

We have explored optical trapping conditions in the near infrared (840-930 nm) that preserve the viability of E. coli, as measured by gene expression of green fluorescent protein. We have found that time-sharing the optical traps, i.e., dwelling only 10 micros-1 ms on the cell, improves viability relative to continuous wave (CW) exposure for the same exposure time. We have also observed that similar to CW traps the photodamage in a time-shared trap depends weakly on wavelength, but linearly on peak power, implying an effect induced by single photon absorption. Taken altogether, integrating the exposure time and peak power, the data indicate that there is a lethal energy dose of about 5 J for E. coli. Thus a single parameter--the energy--can be used to describe the limitation on viability.},

abstract = {Platelet adhesion is an essential function in response to vascular injury and is generally viewed as the first step during which single platelets bind through specific membrane receptors to cellular and extracellular matrix constituents of the vessel wall and tissues. This response initiates thrombus formation that arrests hemorrhage and permits wound healing. Pathological conditions that cause vascular alterations and blood flow disturbances may turn this beneficial process into a disease mechanism that results in arterial occlusion, most frequently in atherosclerotic vessels of the heart and brain. Besides their relevant role in hemostasis and thrombosis, platelet adhesive properties are central to a variety of pathophysiological processes that extend from inflammation to immune-mediated host defense and pathogenic mechanisms as well as cancer metastasis. All of these activities depend on the ability of platelets to circulate in blood as sentinels of vascular integrity, adhere where alterations are detected, and signal the abnormality to other platelets and blood cells. In this respect, therefore, platelet adhesion to vascular wall structures, to one another (aggregation), or to other blood cells, represent different aspects of the same fundamental biological process. Detailed studies by many investigators over the past several years have been aimed to dissect the complexity of these functions, and the results obtained now permit an attempt to integrate all the available information into a picture that highlights the balanced diversity and synergy of distinct platelet adhesive interactions.},

abstract = {Bacteria are arguably the simplest of known microorganisms, forming a fundamental part of the world we live in. Many functions they perform are found in scaled-up versions in higher organisms. Among many advanced functions, bacteria possess the ability to move in search for nutrients and favorable growth conditions. Measurement of the dynamical variables associated with bacterial swimming has proven to be difﬁcult due to the lack of an accurate and convenient tool. In the past optical traps have been used for the manipulation of microscopic objects and measurement of minute forces. Herein, I have devised techniques for use of optical traps for direct measurement of the dynamics of bacterial swimming and chemotaxis, shedding light on the propulsion apparatus and sensory systems. A detailed analysis is performed to explore the effects of non-local hydrodynamic interactions on the swimming of single cells. Due to the lack of reliable measurement techniques, experimentalists often use theoretical models to estimate bacterial dynamics, the validity of which are tested. I emphasize the shortcomings of the very popular Resistive Force Theory (RFT) and indicate how the more rigorous Slender Body Theory (SBT) is able to overcome the limitations. In addition the chemotaxis of the marine bacterial strain Vibrio alginolyticus is studied with the revelation of a previously unknown chemotactic mechanism. Direct observations showed that these cells are able to bend their ﬂagella to impart direction changes, which is paramount for an effective search strategy. This interesting ﬁnd opens several intriguing questions pertaining to chemotaxis.},

abstract = {One limitation on the performance of optical traps is the noise inherently present in every setup. Therefore, it is the desire of most experimentalists to minimize and possibly eliminate noise from their optical trapping experiments. A step in this direction is to quantify the actual noise in the system and to evaluate how much each particular component contributes to the overall noise. For this purpose we present Allan variance analysis as a straightforward method. In particular, it allows for judging the impact of drift which gives rise to low-frequency noise, which is extremely difficult to pinpoint by other methods. We show how to determine the optimal sampling time for calibration, the optimal number of data points for a desired experiment, and we provide measurements of how much accuracy is gained by acquiring additional data points. Allan variances of both micrometer-sized spheres and asymmetric nanometer-sized rods are considered.},

abstract = {The quantitative study of the cell growth [1-5] has led to many fundamental insights in our understanding of a wide range of subjects from cell cycle [6-9] to senescence [10]. Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically [11] and symmetrically [12,13] dividing organisms, implying that a “steady-state” population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of {\~{}}105 individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth of the mother cell inheriting the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diarrhoeal diseases cause illness and death among children younger than 5 years in low-income countries. We designed the Global Enteric Multicenter Study (GEMS) to identify the aetiology and population-based burden of paediatric diarrhoeal disease in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia.

METHODS: The GEMS is a 3-year, prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children aged 0-59 months residing in censused populations at four sites in Africa and three in Asia. We recruited children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea seeking care at health centres along with one to three randomly selected matched community control children without diarrhoea. From patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and controls, we obtained clinical and epidemiological data, anthropometric measurements, and a faecal sample to identify enteropathogens at enrolment; one follow-up home visit was made about 60 days later to ascertain vital status, clinical outcome, and interval growth.

FINDINGS: We enrolled 9439 children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and 13,129 control children without diarrhoea. By analysing adjusted population attributable fractions, most attributable cases of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea were due to four pathogens: rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli producing heat-stable toxin (ST-ETEC; with or without co-expression of heat-labile enterotoxin), and Shigella. Other pathogens were important in selected sites (eg, Aeromonas, Vibrio cholerae O1, Campylobacter jejuni). Odds of dying during follow-up were 8·5-fold higher in patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea than in controls (odd ratio 8·5, 95{\%} CI 5·8-12·5, p<0·0001); most deaths (167 [87·9{\%}]) occurred during the first 2 years of life. Pathogens associated with increased risk of case death were ST-ETEC (hazard ratio [HR] 1·9; 0·99-3·5) and typical enteropathogenic E coli (HR 2·6; 1·6-4·1) in infants aged 0-11 months, and Cryptosporidium (HR 2·3; 1·3-4·3) in toddlers aged 12-23 months.

INTERPRETATION: Interventions targeting five pathogens (rotavirus, Shigella, ST-ETEC, Cryptosporidium, typical enteropathogenic E coli) can substantially reduce the burden of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea. New methods and accelerated implementation of existing interventions (rotavirus vaccine and zinc) are needed to prevent disease and improve outcomes.

abstract = {FimH is a mannose-specific adhesin located on the tip of type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli that is capable of mediating shear-enhanced bacterial adhesion. FimH consists of a fimbria-associated pilin domain and a mannose-binding lectin domain, with the binding pocket positioned opposite the interdomain interface. By using the yeast two-hybrid system, purified lectin and pilin domains, and docking simulations, we show here that the FimH domains interact with one another. The affinity for mannose is greatly enhanced (up to 300-fold) in FimH variants in which the interdomain interaction is disrupted by structural mutations in either the pilin or lectin domains. Also, affinity to mannose is dramatically enhanced in isolated lectin domains or in FimH complexed with the chaperone molecule that is wedged between the domains. Furthermore, FimH with native structure mediates weak binding at low shear stress but shifts to strong binding at high shear, whereas FimH with disrupted interdomain contacts (or the isolated lectin domain) mediates strong binding to mannose-coated surfaces even under low shear. We propose that interactions between lectin and pilin domains decrease the affinity of the mannose-binding pocket via an allosteric mechanism. We further suggest that mechanical force at high shear stress separates the two domains, allowing the lectin domain to switch from a low affinity to a high affinity state. This shift provides a mechanism for FimH-mediated shear-enhanced adhesion by enabling the adhesin to form catch bond-like interactions that are longer lived at high tensile force.},

abstract = {SignificanceFilopodia are essential membrane protrusions that facilitate cellular sensing and interaction with the environment. The mechanical properties of filopodia are crucial for their ability to push and pull on external objects and are attributed to actin dynamics. We confirm the presence of F-actin inside extended filopodia and reveal a new mechanism by which actin can exert traction forces on external objects. This mechanism is mediated by rotation and helical buckling, which cause shortening and retraction of the actin shaft. By imaging of F-actin and simultaneous force spectroscopy, we reveal and detail how force propagates through this spiral actin structure and show how torsional twist of the actin shaft is translated into a traction force at the filopodial tip. Cells can interact with their surroundings via filopodia, which are membrane protrusions that extend beyond the cell body. Filopodia are essential during dynamic cellular processes like motility, invasion, and cell-cell communication. Filopodia contain cross-linked actin filaments, attached to the surrounding cell membrane via protein linkers such as integrins. These actin filaments are thought to play a pivotal role in force transduction, bending, and rotation. We investigated whether, and how, actin within filopodia is responsible for filopodia dynamics by conducting simultaneous force spectroscopy and confocal imaging of F-actin in membrane protrusions. The actin shaft was observed to periodically undergo helical coiling and rotational motion, which occurred simultaneously with retrograde movement of actin inside the filopodium. The cells were found to retract beads attached to the filopodial tip, and retraction was found to correlate with rotation and coiling of the actin shaft. These results suggest a previously unidentified mechanism by which a cell can use rotation of the filopodial actin shaft to induce coiling and hence axial shortening of the filopodial actin bundle.},

abstract = {The shallow depth of field of conventional microscopy hampers analyses of 3D swimming behavior of fast dinoflagellates, whose motility influences macroassemblages of these cells into often-observed dense "blooms." The present analysis of cinematic digital holographic microscopy data enables simultaneous tracking and characterization of swimming of thousands of cells within dense suspensions. We focus on Karlodinium veneficum and Pfiesteria piscicida, mixotrophic and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, respectively, and their preys. Nearest-neighbor distance analysis shows that predator and prey cells are randomly distributed relative to themselves, but, in mixed culture, each predator clusters around its respective prey. Both dinoflagellate species exhibit complex highly variable swimming behavior as characterized by radius and pitch of helical swimming trajectories and by translational and angular velocity. K. veneficum moves in both left- and right-hand helices, whereas P. piscicida swims only in right-hand helices. When presented with its prey (Storeatula major), the slower K. veneficum reduces its velocity, radius, and pitch but increases its angular velocity, changes that reduce its hydrodynamic signature while still scanning its environment as "a spinning antenna." Conversely, the faster P. piscicida increases its speed, radius, and angular velocity but slightly reduces its pitch when exposed to prey (Rhodomonas sp.), suggesting the preferred predation tactics of an "active hunter."},

abstract = {Vaccines are needed against urinary tract infections (UTIs) in children, as episodes of pyelonephritis (PN) may cause renal scarring. Local immune mechanisms are regarded to confer protection, yet they have been poorly characterized for children. This study explores the local immune response in children by looking for newly activated pathogen-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC), expected to appear transiently in the circulation as a response to UTI. Urinary tract-originating ASC specific to each patient's own pathogen or P fimbria were studied in 37 children with PN. The children were examined for recidivism and renal scarring in a 6-month follow-up study. Pathogen-specific ASC were found in 33/37 children, with the magnitude increasing with age. In contrast to the case for adults, with immunoglobulin A (IgA) dominance, in 18/33 cases IgM dominated the response, and this occurred more frequently in infants (63{\%}) than in older children (30{\%}). The most vigorous response was found to whole Escherichia coli bacteria (geometric mean, 63 +/- 2,135 ASC/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]), yet responses were found to P fimbriae (13 +/- 33 ASC/10(6) PBMC), too. The response peaked at 1 to 2 weeks and was low/negligible 3 to 7 weeks after the beginning of symptoms. Recidivism was seen in seven patients, and renal scarring was seen in nine patients. In conclusion, a response of circulating ASC was found in children with UTIs, with the magnitude increasing with age. Since IgM is not present in urine, the IgM dominance of the response suggests that systemic immune mechanisms are more important in the immune defense in children than in adults. In 81{\%} of patients, no recidivism was seen, suggesting a successful immune defense.},

abstract = {Shape dynamics and permeability of a membrane neck connecting a vesicle and plasma membrane are considered. The neck is modeled by a lipid membrane tubule extended between two parallel axisymmetric rings. Within a range of lengths, defined by system geometry and mechanical properties of the membrane, the tubule has two stable shapes: catenoidal microtubule and cylindrical nanotubule. The permeabilities of these two shapes, measured as ionic conductivity of the tubule interior, differ by up to four orders of magnitude. Near the critical length the transitions between the shapes occur within less than a millisecond. Theoretical estimates show that the shape switching is controlled by a single parameter, the tubule length. Thus the tubule connection can operate as a conductivity microswitch, toggling the release of vesicle content in such cellular processes as "kiss-and-run" exocytosis. In support of this notion, bistable behavior of membrane connections between vesicles and the cell plasma membrane in macrophages is demonstrated.},

abstract = {Uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli establish urinary tract infections by attaching to host epithelial cells using adhesive organelles called fimbriae. Fimbriae are helix-like structures with a remarkable adaptability, offering safeguarding for bacteria exposed to changing fluid forces in the urinary tract. We challenged this property of P-fimbriae by cross-linking their subunits with shaft-specific antibodies and measuring the corresponding force response at a single organelle level. Our data show compromised extension and rewinding of P-fimbriae in the presence of antibodies and reduced fimbrial elasticity, which are important properties of fimbriae contributing to the ability of bacteria to cause urinary tract infections. The reduced elasticity found by cross-linking fimbrial subunits could thus be another assignment for antibodies; in addition to marking bacteria as foreign, antibodies physically compromise fimbrial function. We suggest that our assay and results will be a starting point for further investigations aimed at inhibiting sustained bacterial adhesion by antibodies.},

The ability of Gram-negative bacteria to secrete proteins across their outer membrane and to assemble adhesive macromolecular structures on their surface is a defining event in pathogenesis. We elucidated genetic, biochemical, and biophysical requirements for assembly of functional type 1 pili. We discovered that the minor pilus protein FimG plays a critical role in nucleating the formation of the adhesive tip fibrillum. Genetic methods were used to trap pilus subunits during their translocation through the outer membrane usher protein, providing data on the structural interactions that occur between subunit components during type 1 pilus formation. Electron microscopic and biochemical analyses of these stepwise assembly intermediates demonstrated that translocation of pilus subunits occurs linearly through the usher's central channel, with formation of the pilus helix occurring extracellularly. Specialized pilin subunits play unique roles both in this multimerization and in the final ultrastructure of the adhesive pilus.},

abstract = {We determined whether the molecular structures through which force is applied to receptor-ligand pairs are tuned to optimize cell adhesion under flow. The adhesive tethers of our model system, Escherichia coli, are type I fimbriae, which are anchored to the outer membrane of most E. coli strains. They consist of a fimbrial rod (0.3-1.5 microm in length) built from a helically coiled structural subunit, FimA, and an adhesive subunit, FimH, incorporated at the fimbrial tip. Previously reported data suggest that FimH binds to mannosylated ligands on the surfaces of host cells via catch bonds that are enhanced by the shear-originated tensile force. To understand whether the mechanical properties of the fimbrial rod regulate the stability of the FimH-mannose bond, we pulled the fimbriae via a mannosylated tip of an atomic force microscope. Individual fimbriae rapidly elongate for up to 10 microm at forces above 60 pN and rapidly contract again at forces below 25 pN. At intermediate forces, fimbriae change length more slowly, and discrete 5.0 +/- 0.3-nm changes in length can be observed, consistent with uncoiling and coiling of the helical quaternary structure of one FimA subunit at a time. The force range at which fimbriae are relatively stable in length is the same as the optimal force range at which FimH-mannose bonds are longest lived. Higher or lower forces, which cause shorter bond lifetimes, cause rapid length changes in the fimbria that help maintain force at the optimal range for sustaining the FimH-mannose interaction. The modulation of force and the rate at which it is transmitted from the bacterial cell to the adhesive catch bond present a novel physiological role for the fimbrial rod in bacterial host cell adhesion. This suggests that the mechanical properties of the fimbrial shaft have codeveloped to optimize the stability of the terminal adhesive under flow.},

Such systems suffer from limitations when it comes to measurements in a clinic or in a natural setting, for example in the home environment of the patient, since such systems demands a specialised laboratory environment. The systems are also expensive to buy and maintain. Another im- portant factor is the lack of good and easy-to-use tools to ana- lyse and evaluate movements for medical applications.

We review how the physical properties of digesta change during transit through the various segments of the intestine, and how their influence on flow and mixing may be modulated by peristaltic activity. We examine how, in more fluid digesta, the solid and liquid phases interact to influence flow and mixing. Similarly, how in viscid digesta, shear strength, plasticity and elasticity of contained particulate material may influence the permeation of the fluid phase and secretions into and out of the digesta bolus. The manner in which the solid and liquid phases of digesta interact in a partly gaseous environment, such as the lower bowel, to influence bolus cohesion is also examined. Those mechanisms that promote the formation of a less viscous layer at the mucosal interface to promote plug flow are reviewed, and their effect on the efficiency of mixing and digestion discussed.

The hinge-mediated bending was studied, as was the ability of the subclasses to form immune complexes with two anti-Id mAbs. The data show that the rank order (most to least flexible) of the IgG subclasses for hinge-folding mode of flexibility between Fab arms is IgG3 > IgG1 > IgG4 > IgG2. The mean Fab-Fab angles for the subclasses are IgG3, 136 degrees; IgG4, 128 degrees; IgG2, 127 degrees; and IgG1, 117 degrees. Fab-Fc angles were similarly analyzed. By sampling of equimolar mixtures of Id-bearing IgGs and each of two anti-Id mAb after incubation over time (1.5 min to 3.5 h), different kinetic profiles of immune complex formation of defined geometry were documented. Both anti-Id mAbs displayed unique kinetic profiles when complexed with the four IgG subclass molecules but also shared important features. Most notable was the higher propensity to form closed bivalent ring Id-anti-Id dimers with IgG3 than with IgG2 and IgG4. IgG1 was intermediate in its ability to form such dimers.},

abstract = {Human enteric virus infections range from gastroenteritis to life threatening diseases such as myocarditis and aseptic meningitis. Rotavirus is one of the most common enteric agents and mortality associated with infection can be very significant in developing countries. Most enteric viruses produce diseases that are not distinct from other pathogens, and current diagnostics is limited in breadth and sensitivity required to advance virus detection schemes for disease intervention strategies. A spectroscopic assay based on surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been developed for rapid and sensitive detection of rotavirus. The SERS method relies on the fabrication of silver nanorod array substrates that are extremely SERS-active allowing for direct structural characterization of viruses. SERS spectra for eight rotavirus strains were analyzed to qualitatively identify rotaviruses and to classify each according to G and P genotype and strain with >96{\%} accuracy, and a quantitative model based on partial least squares regression analysis was evaluated. This novel SERS-based virus detection method shows that SERS can be used to identify spectral fingerprints of human rotaviruses, and suggests that this detection method can be used for pathogen detection central to human health care.},

This hydrodynamic phenomenon is dominant below a critical shear rate and robust against Brownian motion and cell tumbling. We deduce that individual bacteria entering a flow system can rapidly migrate upstream (>20 ??m/s) much faster than a gradually advancing biofilm. Given a bacterial population with a distribution of sizes and swim speeds, local shear rate near the surface determines the dominant hydrodynamic mode for motility, i.e., circular or random trajectories for low shear rates, positive rheotaxis for moderate flow, and sideways swimming at higher shear rates. Faster swimmers can move upstream more rapidly and at higher shear rates, as expected. Interestingly, we also find on average that both swim speed and upstream motility are independent of cell aspect ratio. ?? 2012 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Uropathogenic P-fimbriated Escherichia coli adheres to host cells by specific adhesins recognizing galabiose (Galalpha1-4Gal)-containing structures on cell surfaces. In search of agents inhibiting this first step of infection, the inhibition potency of a set of synthetic mono- and multivalent galabiose compounds was evaluated. In order to mimic the flow conditions of natural infections, a live-bacteria application of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) was established. METHODS AND RESULTS: For the measurement of the binding of E. coli to a surface containing galabiose, live bacteria were injected over the flow cell, and the inhibition of adhesion caused by the galabiose inhibitors was recorded. Quantitative binding data were recorded in real-time for each inhibitor. The results were compared with those of conventional static haemagglutination and ELISA-based cell adhesion assays. Compared with the Gram-positive Streptococcus suis bacteria, which also bind to galabiose and whose binding inhibition is strongly dependent on the multivalency of the inhibitor, E. coli inhibition was only moderately affected by the valency. However, a novel octavalent compound was found to be the most effective inhibitor of E. coli PapG(J96) adhesion, with an IC50 value of 2 microM. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of bacterial adhesion by SPR is an efficient way to characterize the adhesion of whole bacterial cells and allows the characterization of the inhibitory potency of adhesion inhibitors under dynamic flow conditions. Under these conditions, multivalency increases the anti-adhesion potency of galabiose-based inhibitors of P-fimbriated E. coli adhesion and provides a promising approach for the design of high-affinity anti-adhesion agents.},

abstract = {Red blood cells (RBCs) infected by the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf-RBCs) parasite lose their membrane deformability and they also exhibit enhanced cytoadherence to vascular endothelium and other healthy and infected RBCs. The combined effect may lead to severe disruptions of normal blood circulation due to capillary occlusions. Here we extend the adhesion model to investigate the adhesive dynamics of Pf-RBCs as a function of wall shear stress (WSS) and other parameters using a three-dimensional, multiscale RBC model. Several types of adhesive behavior are identified, including firm adhesion, flipping dynamics, and slow slipping along the wall. In particular, the flipping dynamics of Pf-RBCs observed in experiments appears to be due to the increased stiffness of infected cells and the presence of the solid parasite inside the RBC, which may cause an irregular adhesion behavior. Specifically, a transition from crawling dynamics to flipping behavior occurs at a Young's modulus approximately three times larger than that of healthy RBCs. The simulated dynamics of Pf-RBCs is in excellent quantitative agreement with available microfluidic experiments if the force exerted on the receptors and ligands by an existing bond is modeled as a nonlinear function of WSS.},

abstract = {Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is a novel high-resolution imaging technique that offers real-time imaging and quantitative measurements of physiological parameters. It has developed into a broad field, and one of many interesting applications is to study cells without staining or labeling them and without affecting them in any way. Digital holography makes it possible to easily measure cell properties that previously have been very difficult to study in living cells, such as cell thickness, volume, and cell refractive index (Marquet et al., 2005; Rappaz et al. 2005; M{\"{o}}lder et al., 2008; El-Schish et al., in press; Persson et al., in press). Living, dying or dead cells as well as fixed cells can be studied. The first DHM images showing living cells were published in 2003 and 2004 (You et al., 2003; Carl et al., 2004), making this field of research rather new. Two of the most interesting functions of DHM is 3-D imaging of objects and to make in-focus measurements over time. Digital holography has been used to study a wide range of cells, e.g. protozoa, bacteria and plant cells as well as several types of mammalian cells such as nerve cells and tumor cells (Emery et al., 2007; Kemper et al., 2006; Moon and Javidi 2007). It has also been applied for studies of cell proliferation, cell movement and cell morphology (Kemper et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2009). Movement in both 2-D and 3-D has been studied (Langehanenberg et al., 2009; Persson et al., in press). In addition, cell viability status can be determined using DHM (Kemper et al., 2006; Kemmler et al., 2007). Interestingly, it is possible to study both single cells and entire populations simultaneously, allowing for very detailed studies. In this chapter we will compare DHM with previously used techniques and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of digital holography cell measurements. We will also present cell studies made possible by},

abstract = {P pili are important adhesive fibres involved in kidney infection by uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains. P pili are assembled by the conserved chaperone-usher pathway, which involves the PapD chaperone and the PapC usher. During pilus assembly, subunits are incorporated into the growing fiber via the donor-strand exchange (DSE) mechanism, whereby the chaperone's G1 beta-strand that complements the incomplete immunoglobulin-fold of each subunit is displaced by the N-terminal extension (Nte) of an incoming subunit. P pili comprise a helical rod, a tip fibrillum, and an adhesin at the distal end. PapA is the rod subunit and is assembled into a superhelical right-handed structure. Here, we have solved the structure of a ternary complex of PapD bound to PapA through donor-strand complementation, itself bound to another PapA subunit through DSE. This structure provides insight into the structural basis of the DSE reaction involving this important pilus subunit. Using gel filtration chromatography and electron microscopy on a number of PapA Nte mutants, we establish that PapA differs in its mode of assembly compared with other Pap subunits, involving a much larger Nte that encompasses not only the DSE region of the Nte but also the region N-terminal to it.},

Antibodies against heat-labile enterotoxin and the colonization factors have been shown to be protective, and local immunity in the gut seems to be of prime importance for protection. Hence, several inactivated and live candidate ETEC vaccines consisting of toxin antigens, alone or together with colonization factors, have been evaluated in clinical trials. In this review, the authors describe ETEC vaccine development in progress and the rationale for constructing different types of vaccines.

We therefore used a DNA fragment carrying the CS18 fotA gene as a probe in a hybridization assay to detect the corresponding gene in a CS20-positive strain isolated from an Indian child. Cross hybridizing DNA was isolated and found to contain an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 195 amino acids, including a 22 amino acid signal peptide. The gene, which we named csnA, shows a high degree of identity to the major fimbrial subunits of CS12, CS18 and F6 (also referred to as 987P), a CS of porcine ETEC. The coding region of csnA was inserted into an expression system to generate a polypeptide confirmed to be CS20 by Western blot.

Proceedings of the IEEE Volume 54, Issue 2, Feb. 1966 Page(s): 221 - 230 Digital Object Identifier Summary: A theoretical development is presented which results in a relationship between the expectation value of the standard deviation of the frequency fluctuations for any finite number of data samples and the infinite time average value of the standard deviation, which provides an invariant measure of an important quality factor of a frequency standard. A practical and straightforward method of determining the power spectral density of the frequency fluctuations from the variance of the frequency fluctuations, the sampling time, the number of samples taken, and the dependence on system bandwidth is also developed. Additional insight is also given into some of the problems that arise from the presence of "flicker noise" (spectrum proportional to |$\omega$|{\^{}}(-1)) modulation of the frequency of an oscillator. The theory is applied in classifying the types of noise on the signals of frequency standards made available at NBS, Boulder Laboratories, such as: masers (both H and N15H3), the cesium beam frequency standard employed as the U. S. Frequency Standard, and rubidium gas cells. "Flicker noise" frequency modulation was not observed on the signals of masers for sampling times ranging from 0.1 second to 4 hours. In a comparison between the NBS hydrogen maser and the NBS III cesium beam, uncorrelated random noise was observed on the frequency fluctuations for sampling times extending to 4 hours; the fractional standard deviations of the frequency fluctuations were as low as 5 parts in 10{\^{}}(14).},

While much progress has been made in the nanoscale characterization of pili from Gram-negative bacteria, the adhesive and mechanical properties of Gram-positive bacterial pili remain largely unknown. Here, we use single-molecule atomic force microscopy to unravel the binding mechanism of pili from the probiotic Gram-positive bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). First, we show that SpaC, the key adhesion protein of the LGG pilus, is a multifunctional adhesin with broad specificity. SpaC forms homophilic trans-interactions engaged in bacterial aggregation and specifically binds mucin and collagen, two major extracellular components of host epithelial layers. Homophilic and heterophilic interactions display similar binding strengths and dissociation rates. Next, pulling experiments on living bacteria demonstrate that LGG pili exhibit two unique mechanical responses, that is, zipper-like adhesion involving multiple SpaC molecules distributed along the pilus length and nanospring properties enabling pili to resist high force. These mechanical properties may represent a generic mechanism among Gram-positive bacterial pili for strengthening adhesion and withstanding shear stresses in the natural environment. The single-molecule experiments presented here may help us to design molecules capable of promoting or inhibiting bacterial-host interactions.},

abstract = {In the last decade optical manipulation has evolved from a field of interest for physicists to a versatile tool widely used within life sciences. This has been made possible in particular due to the development of a large variety of imaging techniques that allow detailed information to be gained from investigations of single cells. The use of multiple optical traps has high potential within single-cell analysis since parallel measurements provide good statistics. Multifunctional optical tweezers are, for instance, used to study cell heterogeneity in an ensemble, and force measurements are used to investigate the mechanical properties of individual cells. Investigations of molecular motors and forces on the single-molecule level have led to discoveries that would have been difficult to make with other techniques. Optical manipulation has prospects within the field of cell signalling and tissue engineering. When combined with microfluidic systems the chemical environment of cells can be precisely controlled. Hence the influence of pH, salt concentration, drugs and temperature can be investigated in real time. Fast advancing technical developments of automated and user-friendly optical manipulation tools and cross-disciplinary collaboration will contribute to the routinely use of optical manipulation techniques within the life sciences.},

abstract = {Fimbrial filaments assembled by distinct chaperone pathways share a common mechanism of intersubunit interaction, as elucidated for colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I), archetype of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) Class 5 fimbriae. We postulated that a highly conserved beta-strand at the major subunit N-terminus represents the donor strand, analogous to interactions within Class I pili. We show here that CFA/I fimbriae utilize donor strand complementation to promote proper folding of and interactions between CFA/I subunits. We constructed a series of genetic variants of CfaE, the CFA/I adhesin, incorporating a C-terminal extension comprising a flexible linker and 10-19 of the N-terminal residues of CfaB, the major subunit. Variants with a donor strand complement (dsc) of >or= 12 residues were recoverable from periplasmic fractions. Genetic disruption of the donor beta-strand reduced CfaE recovery. A hexahistidine-tagged variant of dsc19CfaE formed soluble monomers, folded into beta-sheet conformation, displayed adhesion characteristic of CFA/I, and elicited antibodies that inhibited mannose-resistant haemagglutination by ETEC expressing CFA/I, CS4 and CS14 fimbriae. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that CfaE was confined to the distal fimbrial tip. Our findings provide the basis to elucidate structure and function of this class of fimbrial adhesins and assess the feasibility of an adhesin-based vaccine.},

The responses to the HoM, CR, and heterologous (HeT) CF antigens in each group of patient were studied and compared to that seen in healthy children (n = 20). In the CFA/I group (CFA/I and CS14), patients responded with antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses to HoM CFs (geometric mean, 156 to 329 ASCs/10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMCs]) and to CR CFs ( approximately 15 to 38 ASCs/10(6) PBMCs) but least of all to the HeT CS5 antigen (2 to 4 ASCs/10(6) PBMCs). For the CS5 group of patients with ETEC (CS5 and CS7), likewise, responses to HoM CFs (230 to 372 ASCs/10(6) PBMCs) and CR CFs (27 to 676 ASCs/10(6) PBMCs) were seen, along with lower responses to the HeT CFA/I antigen (9 to 38 ASCs/10(6) PBMCs). Both groups of patients responded with CF-specific IgA antibodies to HoM and CR antigens in plasma but responded less to the HeT CFs. The responses in patients were seen very soon after the onset of diarrhea and peaked around 1 week after onset. Vaccinees who had received two doses of the oral, killed whole-cell ETEC vaccine (CF-BS-ETEC) responded with plasma IgA antibodies to CFA/I, a component of the vaccine, but also to the CR CS14 antigen, which was not included in the vaccine, showing that antibody responses can be stimulated by a CFA/I-containing ETEC vaccine to a CR-reacting antigen in individuals in countries where ETEC is endemic.},

@article{Cevc1999,
abstract = {Membrane fusion is essential for cell survival and has attracted a great deal of both theoretical and experimental interest. Fluorescence (de)quenching measurements were designed to distinguish between bilayermerging and vesicle-mixing. Theoretical studies and various microscopic and diffraction methods have elucidated the mechanism of membrane fusion. These have revealed that membrane proximity and high defect density in the adjacent bilayers are the only prerequisites for fusion. Intermediates, such as stalk or inverse micellar structures can, but need not, be involved in vesicle fusion. Nonlamellar phase creation is accompanied by massive membrane fusion although it is not a requirement for bilayer merging. Propensity for membrane fusion is increased by increasing the local membrane disorder as well by performing manipulations that bring bilayers closer together. Membrane rigidification and enlarged bilayer separation opposes this trend. Membrane fusion is promoted by defects created in the bilayer due to the vicinity of lipid phase transition, lateral phase separation or domain generation, high local membrane curvature, osmotic or electric stress in or on the membrane; the addition of amphiphats or macromolecules which insert themselves into the membrane, freezing or other mechanical membrane perturbation have similar effects. Lowering the water activity by the addition of water soluble polymers or by partial system dehydration invokes membrane aggregation and hence facilitates fusion; as does the membrane charge neutralization after proton or other ion binding to the lipids and intermembrane scaffolding by proteins or other macromolecules. The alignment of defect rich domains and polypeptides or protein binding is pluripotent: not only does it increase the number of proximal defects in the bilayers, it triggers the vesicle aggregation and is fusogenic. Exceptions are the bound molecules that create steric or electrical barriers between the membranes which prevent fusion. Membrane fusion can be non-leaky but it is very common to lose material from the vesicle interior during the later stages of membrane unification, that is, after a few hundred microseconds following the induction of fusion.},

abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) of several different serotypes isolated from adults with diarrhea and known to possess the colonization factor antigen (CFA) were found to cause mannose-resistant hemagglutination (HA) of human group A erythrocytes. CFA-negative E. coli isolated during the same study did not possess the mannose-resistant hemagglutinin, although some non-ETEC, CFA-negative isolates did exhibit mannose-sensitive HA activity. The mannoseresistant hemagglutinin of ETEC was found to possess many characteristics previously associated with CFA, which is a surface-associated fimbriate heatlabile antigen, and the functionally and morphologically similar K88 and K99 antigens of animal-specific ETEC. Mannose-resistant HA and CFA titers were maximal when ETEC cells were grown on an agar medium (CFA agar) composed primarily of 1{\%} Casamino Acids and 0.15{\%} yeast extract, pH 7.4. Neither CFA nor HA were produced at a growth temperature of 18 degrees C; HA was completely inhibited by pretreatment of CFA-positive cells with the anti-CFA serum. The mannose-resistant hemagglutinin was lost spontaneously and simultaneously with CFA when clinical ETEC isolates were passaged on artificial medium in the laboratory, indicating plasmid control of both entities. The mannose-resistant hemagglutinin of ETEC was shown to be thermolabile, i.e., sensitive to heating at 65 degrees C, as was the CFA. Also, there was correlation between possession of CFA, as detected serologically and by demonstration of biological activity (adherence in the infant rabbit small intestine), presence of CFA-type fimbriae, and the ability of various E. coli isolates to cause mannose-resistant HA of human group A erythrocytes. These results indicate that the mannose-resistant HA of ETEC is another manifestation of CFA.},

abstract = {We report the first implementation of the fiber based microfluidic Raman spectroscopic detection scheme, which can be scaled down to micrometre dimensions, allowing it to be combined with other microfluidic functional devices. This novel Raman spectroscopic detection scheme, which we termed as Waveguide Confined Raman Spectroscopy (WCRS), is achieved through embedding fibers on-chip in a geometry that confines the Raman excitation and collection region which ensures maximum Raman signal collection. This results in a microfluidic chip with completely alignment-free Raman spectroscopic detection scheme, which does not give any background from the substrate of the chip. These features allow a WCRS based microfluidic chip to be fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) which is a relatively cheap material but has inherent Raman signatures in fingerprint region. The effects of length, collection angle, and fiber core size on the collection efficiency and fluorescence background of WCRS were investigated. The ability of the device to predict the concentration was studied using urea as a model analyte. A major advantage of WCRS is its scalability that allows it to be combined with many existing microfluidic functional devices. The applicability of WCRS is demonstrated through two microfluidic applications: reaction monitoring in a microreactor and detection of analyte in a microdroplet based microfluidic system. The WCRS approach may lead to wider use of Raman spectroscopy based detection in microfluidics, and the development of portable, alignment-free microfluidic devices.},

abstract = {In the intestine, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli works against peristaltic forces, adhering to the epithelium via the colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) fimbrial adhesin CfaE. The CfaE adhesin is similar in localization and tertiary (but not primary) structure to FimH, the type 1 fimbrial adhesin of uropathogenic E. coli, which shows shear-dependent binding to epithelial receptors by an allosteric catch-bond mechanism. Thus, we speculated that CfaE is also capable of shear-enhanced binding. Indeed, bovine erythrocytes coursing over immobilized CFA/I fimbriae in flow chambers exhibited low accumulation levels and fast rolling at low shear, but an 80-fold increase in accumulation and threefold decrease in rolling velocity at elevated shear. This effect was reversible and abolished by pre-incubation of fimbriae with anti-CfaE antibody. Erythrocytes bound to whole CfaE in the same shear-enhanced manner, but to CfaE adhesin domain in a shear-inhibitable fashion. Residue replacements designed to disrupt CfaE interdomain interaction decreased the shear dependency of adhesion and increased binding under static conditions to human intestinal epithelial cells. These findings indicate that close interaction between adhesive and anchoring pilin domains of CfaE keeps the former in a low-affinity state that toggles into a high-affinity state upon separation of two domains, all consistent with an allosteric catch-bond mechanism of CfaE binding.},

abstract = {The interaction between streptavidin and its ligand, biotin, were studied by direct force measurements. The complimentary approaches of surface force apparatus (SFA) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to elucidate both long-range and short-range adhesive interactions of the streptavidin biotin interaction. The high spatial resolution of the SFA provided a detailed profile of the intersurface forces of apposing surfaces functionalized with streptavidin and biotin. Measurements obtained by the SFA corresponded to long and intermediate-range forces that are important in determining ligand receptor association. AFM was used to measure the unbinding force of individual streptavidin biotin complexes. These measurements revealed the short-range interactions (i.e. hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding forces) that stabilize the intermolecular bond.},

After depolymerization, the fimbriae subunits were purified on a Sephacryl S-300 column in 8.0 M-guanidinium chloride. From 1 litre of medium, 4-6 mg of purified fimbriae was obtained. We found that CS2 fimbriae were completely dissociated by saturated guanidinium chloride into subunits with a molecular mass of 16.5 kDa. CS2 fimbriae was sialic acid-specific, since sialic acids were the most potent inhibitors, and neuraminidase treatment of erythrocytes abolished haemagglutination. Both fimbriae and fimbrial subunits were found to bind to bovine erythrocytes. The binding of subunits to erythrocytes could be inhibited with low concentrations of sialyl-lactose.},

Absorption of antibodies to the lipopolysaccharide of the adhering strain markedly decreased the antiadhesive capacity of all the immunoglobulin preparations, whereas elimination of antibodies to the capsular polysaccharide antigen consistently had a small but not significant effect. When urine was absorbed with whole, live bacteria of the patients' infecting strains, the antiadhesive effect completely disappeared.

abstract = {To clear pathogens from host tissues or biomaterial surfaces, phagocytes have to break the adhesive bacteria-substrate interactions. Here we analysed the mechanobiological process that enables macrophages to lift-off and phagocytose surface-bound Escherichia coli (E. coli). In this opsonin-independent process, macrophage filopodia hold on to the E. coli fimbriae long enough to induce a local protrusion of a lamellipodium. Specific contacts between the macrophage and E. coli are formed via the glycoprotein CD48 on filopodia and the adhesin FimH on type 1 fimbriae (hook). We show that bacterial detachment from surfaces occurrs after a lamellipodium has protruded underneath the bacterium (shovel), thereby breaking the multiple bacterium-surface interactions. After lift-off, the bacterium is engulfed by a phagocytic cup. Force activated catch bonds enable the long-term survival of the filopodium-fimbrium interactions while soluble mannose inhibitors and CD48 antibodies suppress the contact formation and thereby inhibit subsequent E. coli phagocytosis.},

The method is size-invariant, and such circular shapes can be found very fast and accurately. Though Fast Circle Detection (FCD) method loses the generality of the CHT, we show that there are many applications that can use this method after a simple preprocessing and gain a considerable improvement in performance against the CHT or its modified versions. This method has been evaluated in some famous industrial and medical fields, and the results show a significant improvement of finding circular shape objects.},

abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) belonging to serogroups O6 and O8 do not possess the H-10407-type colonization factor antigen (CFA/I). However, these frequently isolated ETEC were found to possess a second and distinct heat-labile surface-associated colonization factor antigen, termed CFA/II. Whereas CFA/I mediates mannose-resistant hemagglutination of human group A erythrocytes, CFA/II does not. CFA/II mediates mannose-resistant hemagglutination of bovine erythrocytes, and mannose-resistant hemagglutination is rapid only at reduced temperature (4 degrees C). Because CFA/II, like CFA/I, is spontaneously lost by many ETEC isolates in the laboratory, it was possible to produce specific anti-CFA/II serum by preparing antiserum against living cells of a prototype strain (PB-176) and adsorbing this serum with living and heat-treated cells of its CFA/II-negative derivative strain PB-176-P. This serum, which neutralized the colonization factor activity of CFA/II-positive strains in infant rabbits, was employed to confirm the presence of CFA/II on ETEC which exhibited mannose-resistant hemagglutination of bovine but not human erythrocytes. CFA/II, like CFA/I, mediates adherence of the bacteria to the mucosal surface of the small intestine, as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence. CFA/II appears to be an important virulence factor for humans since CFA/II-positive ETEC are frequently isolated from diarrhea cases, particularly travelers' diarrhea, in Mexico; these ETEC were not uncommon in a collection of isolates from Bangladesh. The O6:H16 strain of ETEC responsible for an outbreak of diarrhea in the United States was also shown to be CFA/II positive. CFA/I and CFA/II were never found on the same serotypes of ETEC, but 98{\%} of the heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxin-producing ETEC belonging to the frequently isolated serogroups O6, O8, O15, O25, O63, and O78 were positive for either CFA/I or CFA/II.},

In particular, we directly measure the force required to hold the bacterium in the optical trap and determine the propulsion matrix, which relates the translational and angular velocity of the flagellum to the torques and forces propelling the bacterium. From the propulsion matrix, dynamical properties such as torques, swimming speed, and power can be obtained by measuring the angular velocity of the motor. We find significant heterogeneities among different individuals even though all bacteria started from a single colony. The propulsive efficiency, defined as the ratio of the propulsive power output to the rotary power input provided by the motors, is found to be approximately 2{\%}, which is consistent with the efficiency predicted theoretically for a rigid helical coil.},

Digital holography became feasible since charged coupled devices (CCDs) with suitable numbers and sizes of pixels and computers with sufficient speed became available. The Fresnel or Fourier holograms are recorded directly by the CCD and stored digitally. No film material involving wet-chemical or other processing is necessary. The reconstruction of the wavefield, which is done optically by illumination of a hologram, is performed by numerical methods. The numerical reconstruction process is based on the Fresnel–Kirchhoff integral, which describes the diffraction of the reconstructing wave at the micro-structure of the hologram. In the numerical reconstruction process not only the intensity, but also the phase distribution of the stored wavefield can be computed from the digital hologram. This offers new possibilities for a variety of applications. Digital holography is applied to measure shape and surface deformation of opaque bodies and refractive index fields within transparent media. Further applications are imaging and microscopy, where it is advantageous to refocusthe area under investigation by numerical methods.},

abstract = {Adhesion pili (fimbriae) play a critical role in initiating the events that lead to intestinal colonization and diarrheal disease by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), an E. coli pathotype that inflicts an enormous global disease burden. We elucidate atomic structures of an ETEC major pilin subunit, CfaB, from colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) fimbriae. These data are used to construct models for 2 morphological forms of CFA/I fimbriae that are both observed in vivo: the helical filament into which it is typically assembled, and an extended, unwound conformation. Modeling and corroborative mutational data indicate that proline isomerization is involved in the conversion between these helical and extended forms. Our findings affirm the strong structural similarities seen between class 5 fimbriae (from bacteria primarily causing gastrointestinal disease) and class 1 pili (from bacteria that cause urinary, respiratory, and other infections) in the absence of significant primary sequence similarity. They also suggest that morphological and biochemical differences between fimbrial types, regardless of class, provide structural specialization that facilitates survival of each bacterial pathotype in its preferred host microenvironment. Last, we present structural evidence for bacterial use of antigenic variation to evade host immune responses, in that residues occupying the predicted surface-exposed face of CfaB and related class 5 pilins show much higher genetic sequence variability than the remainder of the pilin protein.},

abstract = {Substantial costs are associated with the treatment of nosocomial infections, 2 million cases of which occur annually in the United States. Hospital-acquired, gram-negative infection has become an increasing problem, particularly in the intensive care unit where up to 40{\%} of the most frequently isolated strains of Enterobacteriaceae are resistant to standard beta-lactam antibiotics. Among several mechanisms of acquisition of resistance, beta-lactamase production accounts for a high percentage of treatment failures and relapses. By the end of the 1980s, some 10-30{\%} of all nosocomial infections were caused by type-1 beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative isolates, and Enterobacter species had emerged as a major resistant pathogen. The beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as ampicillin/sulbactam, represent an innovative approach to the problem of beta-lactamase-mediated resistance. Clinical use of these agents has been associated with low rates of resistance and new data suggest they may have a specific role in controlling the emergence and spread of nosocomial infections.},

abstract = {S pili are members of the chaperone-usher-pathway-assembled pili family that are predominantly associated with neonatal meningitis (S(II)) and believed to play a role in ascending urinary tract infections (S(I)). We used force-measuring optical tweezers to characterize the intrinsic biomechanical properties and kinetics of S(II) and S(I) pili. Under steady-state conditions, a sequential unfolding of the layers in the helix-like rod occurred at somewhat different forces, 26 pN for S(II) pili and 21 pN for S(I) pili, and there was an apparent difference in the kinetics, 1.3 and 8.8 Hz. Tests with bacteria defective in a newly recognized sfa gene (sfaX (II)) indicated that absence of the sfaX (II) gene weakens the interactions of the fimbrium slightly and decreases the kinetics. Data of S(I) are compared with those of previously assessed pili primary associated with urinary tract infections, the P and type 1 pili. S pili have weaker layer-to-layer bonds than both P and type 1 pili, 21, 28 and 30 pN, respectively. In addition, the S pili kinetics are {\~{}}10 times faster than the kinetics of P pili and {\~{}}550 times faster than the kinetics of type 1 pili. Our results also show that the biomechanical properties of pili expressed ectopically from a plasmid in a laboratory strain (HB101) and pili expressed from the chromosome of a clinical isolate (IHE3034) are identical. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish, by analyzing force-extension data, the different types of pili expressed by an individual cell of a clinical bacterial isolate.},

abstract = {We describe and solve a two-state kinetic model for the forced unfolding of proteins. The protein oligomer is modeled as a heterogeneous, freely jointed chain with two possible values of Kuhn length and contour length representing its folded and unfolded configurations. We obtain analytical solutions for the force-extension response of the protein oligomer for different types of loading conditions. We fit the analytical solutions for constant-velocity pulling to the force-extension data for ubiquitin and fibrinogen and obtain model parameters, such as Kuhn lengths and kinetic coefficients, for both proteins. We then predict their response under a linearly increasing force and find that our solutions for ubiquitin are consistent with a different set of experiments. Our calculations suggest that the refolding rate of proteins at low forces is several orders larger than the unfolding rate, and neglecting it can lead to lower predictions for the unfolding force, especially at high stretching velocities. By accounting for the refolding of proteins we obtain a critical force below which equilibrium is biased in favor of the folded state. Our calculations also suggest new methods to determine the distance of the transition state from the energy wells representing the folded and unfolded states of a protein.},

abstract = {ETEC is an underrecognized but extremely important cause of diarrhea in the developing world where there is inadequate clean water and poor sanitation. It is the most frequent bacterial cause of diarrhea in children and adults living in these areas and also the most common cause of traveler's diarrhea. ETEC diarrhea is most frequently seen in children, suggesting that a protective immune response occurs with age. The pathogenesis of ETEC-induced diarrhea is similar to that of cholera and includes the production of enterotoxins and colonization factors. The clinical symptoms of ETEC infection can range from mild diarrhea to a severe cholera-like syndrome. The effective treatment of ETEC diarrhea by rehydration is similar to treatment for cholera, but antibiotics are not used routinely for treatment except in traveler's diarrhea. The frequency and characterization of ETEC on a worldwide scale are inadequate because of the difficulty in recognizing the organisms; no simple diagnostic tests are presently available. Protection strategies, as for other enteric infections, include improvements in hygiene and development of effective vaccines. Increases in antimicrobial resistance will dictate the drugs used for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea. Efforts need to be made to improve our understanding of the worldwide importance of ETEC.},

abstract = {A digital holographic microscope is used to simultaneously measure the instantaneous 3D flow structure in the inner part of a turbulent boundary layer over a smooth wall, and the spatial distribution of wall shear stresses. The measurements are performed in a fully developed turbulent channel flow within square duct, at a moderately high Reynolds number. The sample volume size is 90 x 145 x 90 wall units, and the spatial resolution of the measurements is 3-8 wall units in streamwise and spanwise directions and one wall unit in the wall-normal direction. The paper describes the data acquisition and analysis procedures, including the particle tracking method and associated method for matching of particle pairs. The uncertainty in velocity is estimated to be better than 1 mm/s, less than 0.05{\%} of the free stream velocity, by comparing the statistics of the normalized velocity divergence to divergence obtained by randomly adding an error of 1 mm/s to the data. Spatial distributions of wall shear stresses are approximated with the least square fit of velocity measurements in the viscous sublayer. Mean flow profiles and statistics of velocity fluctuations agree very well with expectations. Joint probability density distributions of instantaneous spanwise and streamwise wall shear stresses demonstrate the significance of near-wall coherent structures. The near wall 3D flow structures are classified into three groups, the first containing a pair of counter-rotating, quasi streamwise vortices and high streak-like shear stresses; the second group is characterized by multiple streamwise vortices and little variations in wall stress; and the third group has no buffer layer structures},

abstract = {The mechanisms that determine bacterial shape are in many ways poorly understood. A prime example is the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi), which mechanically couples its motility organelles, helical flagella, to its rod-shaped cell body, producing a striking flat-wave morphology. A mathematical model is developed here that accounts for the elastic coupling of the flagella to the cell cylinder and shows that the flat-wave morphology is in fact a natural consequence of the geometrical and material properties of the components. Observations of purified periplasmic flagella show two flagellar conformations. The mathematical model suggests that the larger waveform flagellum is the more relevant for determining the shape of B. burgdorferi. Optical trapping experiments were used to measure directly the mechanical properties of these spirochetes. These results imply relative stiffnesses of the two components, which confirm the predictions of the model and show that the morphology of B. burgdorferi is completely determined by the elastic properties of the flagella and cell body. This approach is applicable to a variety of other structures in which the shape of the composite system is markedly different from that of the individual components, such as coiled-coil domains in proteins and the eukaryotic axoneme.},

Cell shape is the product of a cell's material and active properties balanced by external forces. Control of cell shape, therefore, relies on both tight regulation of intracellular mechanics and the cell's physical interaction with its environment. In this review, we first discuss the biological and physical mechanisms of cell shape control. We next examine a number of developmental processes in which cell shape change - either individually or in a coordinated manner - drives embryonic morphogenesis and discuss how cell shape is controlled in these processes. Finally, we emphasize that cell shape control during tissue morphogenesis can only be fully understood by using a combination of cellular, molecular, developmental and biophysical approaches.},

abstract = {The ability of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) to cause urinary tract infections is dependent on their ability to colonize the uroepithelium. Infecting bacteria ascend the urethra to the bladder and then kidneys by attaching to the uroepithelial cells via the differential expression of adhesins. P pili are associated with pyelonephritis, the more severe infection of the kidneys. In order to find means to treat pyelonephritis, it is therefore of interest to investigate the properties P pili. The mechanical behavior of individual P pili of uropathogenic Escherichia coli has recently been investigated using optical tweezers. P pili, whose main part constitutes the PapA rod, composed of similar to1000 PapA subunits in a helical arrangement, are distributed over the bacterial surface and mediate adhesion to host cells. We have earlier studied P pili regarding its stretclring/elongation properties where we have found and characterized three different elongation regions, of which one constitute an unfolding of the quaternary (helical) structure of the PapA rod. It was shown that this unfolding takes place at an elongation independent force of 27 +/- 2 pN. We have also recently performed studies on its folding properties and shown that the unfolding/folding of the PapA rod is completely reversible. Here we present a study of the dynamical properties of the PapA rod. We show, among other things, that the unfolding force increases and that the folding force decreases with the speed of unfolding and folding respectively. Moreover, the PapA rod can be folded-unfolded a significant number of times without loosing its characteristics, a phenomenon that is believed to be important for the bacterium to keep close contact to the host tissue and consequently helps the bacterium to colonize the host tissue.},

SNX9 binds strongly to dynamin and is partly responsible for the recruitment of this GTPase to sites of endocytosis. SNX9 also has a high capacity for modulation of the membrane and might therefore participate in the formation of the narrow neck of endocytic vesicles before scission occurs. Once assembled on the membrane, SNX9 stimulates the GTPase activity of dynamin to facilitate the scission reaction. It has also become clear that SNX9 has the ability to activate the actin regulator N-WASP in a membrane-dependent manner to coordinate actin polymerization with vesicle release. In this Commentary, we summarize several aspects of SNX9 structure and function in the context of membrane remodeling, discuss its interplay with various interaction partners and present a model of how SNX9 might work in endocytosis.},

abstract = {Certain strains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli adhere to piglet intestinal epithelial cells by means of the 987P fimbriae. The 987P fimbrial structure consists of a helical arrangement of three fimbrial proteins, namely, the major subunit FasA and two minor subunits, FasF and FasG. FasG, which is located at the fimbrial tip and at various positions along the fimbriae, mediates 987P binding to glycoprotein receptors. In this study, we isolated and analyzed the structure of piglet glycolipid brush border receptors and characterized their cognate ligands on the 987P fimbriae. Two major glycolipid bands recognized by 987P fimbrial probes in thin-layer chromatography overlay assays were further purified by high-performance thin-layer chromatography and shown to comigrate with control galactosylceramide containing hydroxylated fatty acids and with sulfatide. Their structures were confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, which detected homologous series of ceramide monohexoside and sulfatide with hydroxylated fatty acyl chains ranging from h16:0 to h24:0. Assembled 987P fimbriae, pre- and postassembly dissociated fimbrial subunits, and Fab fragments of specific anti-FasG, -FasF, and -FasA were used to inhibit 987P-mediated bacterial binding to the two identified piglet glycolipids and corresponding isoreceptor controls. Only assembled fimbriae and anti-FasG Fab fragments were significantly able to inhibit bacterial binding to sulfatide, indicating that in addition to glycoproteins, FasG recognizes a specific glycolipid of piglet brush borders. In contrast, only anti-FasA Fab fragments were significantly able to inhibit bacterial binding to galactosylceramide with hydroxylated fatty acids and piglet hydroxylated ceramide monohexoside, indicating that FasA may determine a third type of ligand-receptor interaction in the piglet intestines. Since these bacterial adhesins recognize their respective glycolipid receptors only after being assembled in their final fimbrial quaternary structure, adhesin binding may involve cooperative interactions and the subunits by themselves may have very low binding affinities. Alternatively, conformation-sensitive domains of these subunits present in the assembled fimbriae may be required for glycolipid binding.},

abstract = {Myosin-V is a processive two-headed actin-based motor protein involved in many intracellular transport processes. A key question for understanding myosin-V function and the communication between its two heads is its behavior under load. Since in vivo myosin-V colocalizes with other much stronger motors like kinesins, its behavior under superstall forces is especially relevant. We used optical tweezers with a long-range force feedback to study myosin-V motion under controlled external forward and backward loads over its full run length. We find the mean step size remains constant at approximately 36 nm over a wide range of forces from 5 pN forward to 1.5 pN backward load. We also find two force-dependent transitions in the chemomechanical cycle. The slower ADP-release is rate limiting at low loads and depends only weakly on force. The faster rate depends more strongly on force. The stronger force dependence suggests this rate represents the diffusive search of the leading head for its binding site. In contrast to kinesin motors, myosin-V's run length is essentially independent of force between 5 pN of forward to 1.5 pN of backward load. At superstall forces of 5 pN, we observe continuous backward stepping of myosin-V, indicating that a force-driven reversal of the power stroke is possible.},

abstract = {This paper presents a computationally efficient, two-dimensional, feature point tracking algorithm for the automated detection and quantitative analysis of particle trajectories as recorded by video imaging in cell biology. The tracking process requires no a priori mathematical modeling of the motion, it is self-initializing, it discriminates spurious detections, and it can handle temporary occlusion as well as particle appearance and disappearance from the image region. The efficiency of the algorithm is validated on synthetic video data where it is compared to existing methods and its accuracy and precision are assessed for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithm is well suited for video imaging in cell biology relying on low-intensity fluorescence microscopy. Its applicability is demonstrated in three case studies involving transport of low-density lipoproteins in endosomes, motion of fluorescently labeled Adenovirus-2 particles along microtubules, and tracking of quantum dots on the plasma membrane of live cells. The present automated tracking process enables the quantification of dispersive processes in cell biology using techniques such as moment scaling spectra.},

abstract = {Urinary tract infections are caused by Uropathogenic Escherichia coli. It is therefore of great interest to study how the adhesion of these bacteria to the walls of the urinary tract is affected by changes in pH and salt concentration in the urine. Using a multivariate experimental design, a mathematical model for how pH and different salinity affect E coli P pili refolding was calculated. The refolding of the P pili was measured at different levels of pH and salt concentration. The measurements were made using optical tweezers. By calculating the relative number of misfolding PapA units, the change in influence of pH and salinity was quantified. The biggest influence on the refolding process turned out to be pH. Though changes in both pH and salinity from the neutral region affect the refolding negatively. The final model for the refolding is , where MF is the quantification of the changes in the refolding process.},

abstract = {Adhesion plays a major role in the bacterial lifestyle. Bacteria can adhere to organic and inorganic surfaces, to each other, and of course to host cells during pathogenesis. The focus of this book is: how are such adhesion phenomena best studied? Microbial genetics experiments have greatly enhanced our knowledge of what bacterial factors are involved in adhesion. For numerous reasons, though, biochemical and structural biology knowledge of the molecular interactions involved in adhesion are limited. One major problem has been a lack of interdisciplinary research and understanding in the field. On the one hand, the microbiologists lack detailed knowledge of the biophysical possibilities and have limited access to the frequently expensive instrumentation involved while on the other hand, the experts in these methods frequently do not have access to the biological materials, nor do they necessarily understand the biological questions to be answered. The purpose of this book is thus to overcome this gap in communication between researchers in biology, chemistry and physics and to display the many ways and means to investigate bacterial adhesion. We hope to stimulate new and ground-breaking research.},

The criterion we propose here operates on high-pass filtered complex amplitudes. It is shown that the proposed criterion gives a minimum for both types of objects when the focus plane is reached.

This is accomplished by combining a micro Raman set-up with optical tweezers and a microfluidic system. The latter gives full control over the media surrounding the cell, and it consists of a pattern of channels and reservoirs defined by electron beam lithography that is moulded into rubber silicon (PDMS). Different buffers can be transported through the channels using electro-osmotic flow, while the resonance Raman response of an optically trapped red blood cell (RBC) is simultaneously registered. This makes it possible to monitor the oxygenation cycle of the cell in real time and to investigate effects like photo-induced chemistry caused by the illumination. The experimental set-up has high potential for in vivo monitoring of cellular drug response using a variety of spectroscopic probes.},

abstract = {Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are a significant health concern, exacerbated by the rapid emergence of multidrug resistant strains refractory to antibiotic treatment. P fimbriae are strongly associated with upper urinary tract colonization due to specific binding to $\alpha$-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-4)-$\beta$-D-galactopyranoside receptors in the kidneys. Thus, inhibiting P-fimbrial adhesion may reduce the incidence of UPEC-mediated UTI. E. coli 83972 is an asymptomatic bacteriuria isolate successfully used as a prophylactic agent to prevent UTI in human studies. We constructed a recombinant E. coli 83972 strain displaying a surface-located oligosaccharide P fimbriae receptor mimic that bound to P-fimbriated E. coli producing any of the 3 PapG adhesin variants. The recombinant strain, E. coli 83972::lgtCE, impaired P fimbriae-mediated adhesion to human erythrocytes and kidney epithelial cells. Additionally, E. coli 83972::lgtCE impaired urine colonization by UPEC in a mouse UTI model, demonstrating its potential as a prophylactic agent to prevent UTI.},

abstract = {We have developed a method, using laser, optical tweezers and direct microscopic analysis of reproductive potential and membrane integrity, to assess single-cell viability in a stationary-phase Escherichia coli population. It is demonstrated here that a reduction in cell integrity, determined by using the fluorescent nucleic acid stain propidium iodide, correlated well with a reduction in cell proliferating potential during the stationary-phase period studied. Moreover, the same cells that exhibited reduced integrity were found to be the ones that failed to divide upon nutrient addition. A small but significant number of the intact cells (496 of 7,466 [6.6{\%}]) failed to replicate. In other words, we did not find evidence for the existence of a large population of intact but nonculturable cells during the stationary-phase period studied but it is clear that reproductive ability can be lost prior to the loss of membrane integrity. In addition, about 1{\%} of the stationary-phase cells were able to divide only once upon nutrient addition, and in a few cases, only one of the two cells produced by division was able to divide a second time, indicating that localized cell deterioration, inherited by only one of the daughters, may occur. The usefulness of the optical trapping methodology in elucidating the mechanisms involved in stationary-phase-induced bacterial death and population heterogeneity is discussed.},

We present a multiscale RBC model that is able to predict RBC mechanics, rheology, and dynamics in agreement with experiments. Based on an analytic theory, the modeled membrane properties can be uniquely related to the experimentally established RBC macroscopic properties without any adjustment of parameters. The RBC linear and nonlinear elastic deformations match those obtained in optical-tweezers experiments. The rheological properties of the membrane are compared with those obtained in optical magnetic twisting cytometry, membrane thermal fluctuations, and creep followed by cell recovery. The dynamics of RBCs in shear and Poiseuille flows is tested against experiments and theoretical predictions, and the applicability of the latter is discussed. Our findings clearly indicate that a purely elastic model for the membrane cannot accurately represent the RBC's rheological properties and its dynamics, and therefore accurate modeling of a viscoelastic membrane is necessary.},

Cuffs placed on the limb support the rigidity of the triads. Additional markers are used to mark the approximate positions of joints. Corrections of surface marker data for skin motion are derived from a priori knowledge about plausible joint motions. In addition, ill-conditioned states are trapped when the elbow is nearly fully extended. The protocol is applied to sample motions which demonstrate the use and the effect of the corrections. The results show that the model assumptions are reasonable and that accurate joint rotations can be obtained.

abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are a major cause of diarrheal disease worldwide. Adhesion pili (or fimbriae), such as the CFA/I (colonization factor antigen I) organelles that enable ETEC to attach efficiently to the host intestinal tract epithelium, are critical virulence factors for initiation of infection. We characterized the intrinsic biomechanical properties and kinetics of individual CFA/I pili at the single-organelle level, demonstrating that weak external forces (7.5 pN) are sufficient to unwind the intact helical filament of this prototypical ETEC pilus and that it quickly regains its original structure when the force is removed. While the general relationship between exertion of force and an increase in the filament length for CFA/I pili associated with diarrheal disease is analogous to that of P pili and type 1 pili, associated with urinary tract and other infections, the biomechanical properties of these different pili differ in key quantitative details. Unique features of CFA/I pili, including the significantly lower force required for unwinding, the higher extension speed at which the pili enter a dynamic range of unwinding, and the appearance of sudden force drops during unwinding, can be attributed to morphological features of CFA/I pili including weak layer-to-layer interactions between subunits on adjacent turns of the helix and the approximately horizontal orientation of pilin subunits with respect to the filament axis. Our results indicate that ETEC CFA/I pili are flexible organelles optimized to withstand harsh motion without breaking, resulting in continued attachment to the intestinal epithelium by the pathogenic bacteria that express these pili.},

Both experiment and theory show that the statistics of the bead motion are quite different from those of a free semiflexible polymer. Our experimental data for chain extension versus tether length fit our model over a range of tether lengths from 109 to 3477 base pairs, using a value for the DNA persistence length that is consistent with those obtained under similar solution conditions by other methods. Moreover, we present the first experimental determination of the full probability distribution function of bead displacements and find excellent agreement with our theoretical prediction. Our results show that TPM is a useful tool for monitoring large conformational changes such as DNA looping.},

@article{Rivetti1996,
abstract = {This paper reports a study of the deposition process of DNA molecules onto a mica surface for imaging under the scanning force microscope (SFM). Kinetic experiments indicate that the transport of DNA molecules from the solution drop onto the surface is governed solely by diffusion, and that the molecules are irreversibly adsorbed onto the substrate. A statistical polymer chain analysis has been applied to DNA molecules to determine the deposition conditions that lead to equilibrium and those that result in trapped configurations. Using the appropriate conditions, DNA molecules deposited onto freshly cleaved mica, are able to equilibrate on the surface as in an ideal two-dimensional solution. A persistence length of 53 nm was determined from those molecules. DNA fragments that were labeled on both ends with a horseradish peroxidase streptavidin fusion protein were still able to equilibrate on the surface, despite the additional protein-surface interaction. In contrast, DNA molecules deposited onto glow-discharged mica or H+-exchanged mica do not equilibrate on the surface. These molecules adopt conformations similar to those expected for a simple projection onto the surface plane, suggesting a process of kinetic trapping. These results validate recent SFM application to quantitatively analyze the conformation of complex macromolecular assemblies deposited on mica. Under equilibration conditions, the present study indicates that the SFM can be used to determine the persistence length of DNA molecules to a high degree of precision.},

abstract = {A subtype (CS2) of the colonization factor antigen II (CFA/II) of human enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) was studied. Analysis revealed that CS2-possessing ETEC was predominant among isolates from traveller's diarrhea at Osaka, Japan. TH61 pili produced by a clinical strain (TH61) were purified as a native form to homogeneity by zone electrophoresis and successive column chromatographies on Sepharose 4B and Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B. It was demonstrated by immunogold staining technique and bacterial agglutination test that antisera against the purified pili of strain TH61 recognized pili of both strain TH61 and strain {\#}C91f, a control strain possessing only CS2 pili. This suggests that TH61 pili purified in this study are CS2 pili. Subunit (pilin) of the purified pili has a molecular weight of about 16,000. Strains bearing CS2 could attach to human jejunal epithelial cells, and this attachment was inhibited by pretreating the enterocytes with purified pili. These indicate that CS2 pili are a factor responsible for attachment of ETEC bearing CS2 to human intestinal cells.},

The random sphere assemblies comprised monolayers, double layers and triple layers. The Reynolds number based on the sphere radius and the overall shear rate was much smaller than 1. The results were interpreted in terms of the drag force (the force in the streamwise direction) and lift force (the force in the wall-normal direction) experienced by the spheres as a function of the denseness of the bed and the depth of the spheres in the bed. The average drag and lift forces decay monotonically as a function of the surface coverage of the spheres in the top layer of the bed. The sphere-to-sphere variation of the drag and lift forces is significant due to interactions between spheres via the interstitial fluid flow.},

abstract = {An improved enterocyte adhesion assay has been used to examine a collection of 44 strains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) for their ability to adhere to the brush border of isolated human duodenal enterocytes. Fourteen strains showed good adhesion; in each case the ability to adhere correlated with the production of colonization factor antigen I or II (CFA/I or CFA/II) fimbriae. CFA/II-positive producing coli surface antigens 1 and 3 (CS1 and CS3), coli surface antigens 2 and 3 (CS2 and CS3), and only coli surface antigen 3 (CS3) each showed good adhesion. CS3-mediated brush border attachment of CFA/II-positive ETEC was demonstrated by electron microscopy with monospecific antibody and an immunogold labeling technique. One CFA/I-positive ETEC strain was nonadherent in the assay, as were ETEC producing type 1 somatic fimbriae. Five animal ETEC strains producing K88, K99, F41, and 987P fimbriae were slightly more adhesive than control strains, but adhesion was significantly less than that of CFA-positive ETEC. Twenty five human ETEC strains that lacked CFA/I and CFA/II were nonadherent, suggesting either that the surface antigens responsible for adhesion to human intestinal mucosa in these strains were not being produced or that mucosal receptors for these strains are present in regions of the small intestine other than the duodenum.},

abstract = {P pili are protein filaments expressed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli that mediate binding to glycolipids on epithelial cell surfaces, which is a prerequisite for bacterial infection. When a bacterium, attached to a cell surface, is exposed to external forces, the pili, which are composed of approximately 10(3) PapA protein subunits arranged in a helical conformation, can elongate by unfolding to a linear conformation. This property is considered important for the ability of a bacterium to withstand shear forces caused by urine flow. It has hitherto been assumed that this elongation is plastic, thus constituting a permanent conformational deformation. We demonstrate, using optical tweezers, that this is not the case; the unfolding of the helical structure to a linear conformation is fully reversible. It is surmised that this reversibility helps the bacteria regain close contact to the host cells after exposure to significant shear forces, which is believed to facilitate their colonization.},

abstract = {Immunoglobulins form an important component of the immunological activity found in milk and colostrum. They are central to the immunological link that occurs when the mother transfers passive immunity to the offspring. The mechanism of transfer varies among mammalian species. Cattle provide a readily available immune rich colostrum and milk in large quantities, making those secretions important potential sources of immune products that may benefit humans. Immune milk is a term used to describe a range of products of the bovine mammary gland that have been tested against several human diseases. The use of colostrum or milk as a source of immunoglobulins, whether intended for the neonate of the species producing the secretion or for a different species, can be viewed in the context of the types of immunoglobulins in the secretion, the mechanisms by which the immunoglobulins are secreted, and the mechanisms by which the neonate or adult consuming the milk then gains immunological benefit. The stability of immunoglobulins as they undergo processing in the milk, or undergo digestion in the intestine, is an additional consideration for evaluating the value of milk immunoglobulins. This review summarizes the fundamental knowledge of immunoglobulins found in colostrum, milk, and immune milk.},

@article{Heinrich1999a,
abstract = {A sufficiently large force acting on a single point of the fluid membrane of a flaccid phospholipid vesicle is known to cause the formation of a narrow bilayer tube (tether). We analyze this phenomenon by means of general mathematical methods allowing us to determine the shapes of strongly deformed vesicles including their stability. Starting from a free vesicle with an axisymmetric, prolate equilibrium shape, we consider an axial load that pulls (or pushes) the poles of the vesicle apart. Arranging the resulting shapes of strained vesicles in dependence of the axial deformation and of the area difference of monolayers, phase diagrams of stable shapes are presented comprising prolate shapes with or without equatorial mirror symmetry. For realistic values of membrane parameters, we study the force-extension relation of strained vesicles, and we demonstrate in detail how the initially elongated shape of an axially stretched vesicle transforms into a shape involving a membrane tether. This tethering transition may be continuous or discontinuous. If the free vesicle is mirror symmetric, the mirror symmetry is broken as the tether forms. The stability analysis of tethered shapes reveals that, for the considered vesicles, the stable shape is always asymmetric (polar), i.e., it involves only a single tether on one side of the main vesicle body. Although a bilayer tube formed from a closed vesicle is not an ideal cylinder, we show that, for most practical purposes, it is safe to assume a cylindrical geometry of tethers. This analysis is supplemented by the documentation of a prototype experiment supporting our theoretical predictions. It shows that the currently accepted model for the description of lipid-bilayer elasticity (generalized bilayer couple model) properly accounts for the tethering phenomenon.},

Using single molecule analysis, we directly examined the stability of the CI-operator structure in its natural, supercoiled state. We marked positions adjacent to the $\lambda$ operators with peptide nucleic acids and monitored their movement by tethered particle tracking. Compared with relaxed DNA, the presence of supercoils greatly enhances juxtaposition probability.

Even organisms that remain sessile most of the time, like flowering plants and trees, are quite busy at the cellular level, with large organelles, including chloroplasts, constantly racing around within cellular boundaries. Directed biological movement requires that the cell be able to convert its abundant stores of chemical energy into mechanical energy. Understanding how this mechanochemical energy transduction takes place and understanding how small biological forces generated at the molecular level are marshaled and organized for large-scale cellular or organismal movements are the focus of the field of cell motility.

abstract = {The technically challenging field of single-molecule biophysics has established itself in the last decade by granting access to detailed information about the fate of individual biomolecules, unattainable in traditional biochemical assays. The appeal of single-molecule methods lies in the directness of the information obtained from individual biomolecules. Technological improvements in single-molecule methods have made it possible to combine optical tweezers, fluorescence microscopy, and microfluidic flow systems. Such a combination of techniques has opened new possibilities to study complex biochemical reactions on the single-molecule level. In this chapter, we provide general considerations for the development of a combined optical trapping, fluorescence microscopy, and microfluidics instrument, along with methods to solve technical issues that are critical for designing successful experiments. Finally, we present several experiments to illustrate the power of this combination of techniques.},

abstract = {Instrumentationand methodologies for single molecule force spectroscopy on bacterial adhesionorganelles by the use of force measuring optical tweezers havebeen developed. A thorough study of the biomechanical properties offimbrial adhesion organelles expressed by uropathogenic E. coli, so-called pili,is presented. Steady-state as well as dynamic force measurements onP pili, expressed by E. coli causing pyelonephritis, have revealed,among other things, various unfolding and refolding properties of thehelical structure of P pili, the PapA rod. Based onthese properties an energy landscape model has been constructed bywhich specific biophysical properties of the PapA rod have beenextracted, e.g. the number of subunits, the length of asingle pilus, bond lengths and activation energies for bond openingand closure. Moreover, long time repetitive measurements have shown thatthe rod can be unfolded and refolded repetitive times withoutlosing its intrinsic properties. These properties are believed to beof importance for the bacteria's ability to maintain close contactwith host cells during initial infections. The results presented areconsidered to be of importance for the field of biopolymersin general and the development of new pharmaceuticals towards urinarytract infections in particular. The results show furthermore that themethodology can be used to gain knowledge of the intrinsicbiomechanical function of adhesion organelles. The instrumentation is currently usedfor characterization of type 1 pili, expressed by E. colicausing cystitis, i.e. infections in the bladder. The first forcespectrometry investigations of these pili will be presented. ©2006 COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

abstract = {Platelet aggregation, which contributes to bleeding arrest and also to thrombovascular disorders, is thought to initiate after signaling-induced activation. We found that this paradigm does not apply under blood flow conditions comparable to those existing in stenotic coronary arteries. Platelets interacting with immobilized von Willebrand factor (VWF) aggregate independently of activation when soluble VWF is present and the shear rate exceeds 10 000 s(-1) (shear stress = 400 dyn/cm(2)). Above this threshold, active A1 domains become exposed in soluble VWF multimers and can bind to glycoprotein Ibalpha, promoting additional platelet recruitment. Aggregates thus formed are unstable until the shear rate approaches 20 000 s(-1) (shear stress = 800 dyn/cm.(2)). Above this threshold, adherent platelets at the interface of surface-immobilized and membrane-bound VWF are stretched into elongated structures and become the core of aggregates that can persist on the surface for minutes. When isolated dimeric A1 domain is present instead of native VWF multimers, activation-independent platelet aggregation occurs without requiring shear stress above a threshold level, but aggregates never become firmly attached to the surface and progressively disaggregate as shear rate exceeds 6000 s(-1). Platelet and VWF modulation by hydrodynamic force is a mechanism for activation-independent aggregation that may support thrombotic arterial occlusion.},

abstract = {Scope: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to directly measure the nanoscale adhesion forces between P-fimbriated Escherichia coli (E. coli) and human uroepithelial cells exposed to cranberry juice, in order to reveal the molecular mechanisms by which cranberry juice cocktail (CJC) affects bacterial adhesion.Methods and results: Bacterial cell probes were created by attaching P-fimbriated E. coli HB101pDC1 or non-fimbriated E. coli HB101 to AFM tips, and the cellular probes were used to directly measure the adhesion forces between E. coli and uroepithelial cells in solutions containing: 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 27 wt{\%} CJC. Macroscale attachment of E. coli to uroepithelial cells was measured and correlated to nanoscale adhesion force measurements. The adhesion forces between E. coli HB101pDC1 and uroepithelial cells were dose-dependent, and decreased from 9.32+/-2.37 nN in the absence of CJC to 0.75+/-0.19 nN in 27 wt{\%} CJC. Adhesion forces between E. coli HB101 and uroepithelial cells were low in buffer (0.74+/-0.18 nN), and did not change significantly in CJC (0.78+/-0.18 nN in 27 wt{\%} CJC; P=0.794).Conclusion: Our study shows that CJC significantly decreases nanoscale adhesion forces between P-fimbriated E. coli and uroepithelial cells.},

abstract = {Filamentous type 1 pili are responsible for attachment of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains to host cells. They consist of a linear tip fibrillum and a helical rod formed by up to 3000 copies of the main structural pilus subunit FimA. The subunits in the pilus interact via donor strand complementation, where the incomplete, immunoglobulin-like fold of each subunit is complemented by an N-terminal donor strand of the subsequent subunit. Here, we show that folding of FimA occurs at an extremely slow rate (half-life: 1.6 h) and is catalyzed more than 400-fold by the pilus chaperone FimC. Moreover, FimA is capable of intramolecular self-complementation via its own donor strand, as evidenced by the loss of folding competence upon donor strand deletion. Folded FimA is an assembly-incompetent monomer of low thermodynamic stability (-10.1 kJ mol(-1)) that can be rescued for pilus assembly at 37 °C because FimC selectively pulls the fraction of unfolded FimA molecules from the FimA folding equilibrium and allows FimA refolding on its surface. Elongation of FimA at the C-terminus by its own donor strand generated a self-complemented variant (FimAa) with alternative folding possibilities that spontaneously adopts the more stable conformation (-85.0 kJ mol(-1)) in which the C-terminal donor strand is inserted in the opposite orientation relative to that in FimA. The solved NMR structure of FimAa revealed extensive $\beta$-sheet hydrogen bonding between the FimA pilin domain and the C-terminal donor strand and provides the basis for reconstruction of an atomic model of the pilus rod.},

abstract = {CfaE is the minor, tip-localized adhesive subunit of colonization factor antigen I fimbriae (CFA/I) of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and is thought to be essential for the attachment of enterotoxigenic E. coli to the human small intestine early in diarrhea pathogenesis. The crystal structure of an in cis donor strand complemented CfaE was determined, providing the first atomic view of a fimbrial subunit assembled by the alternate chaperone pathway. The in cis donor strand complemented variant of CfaE structure consists of an N-terminal adhesin domain and a C-terminal pilin domain of similar size, each featuring a variable immunoglobulin-like fold. Extensive interactions exist between the two domains and appear to rigidify the molecule. The upper surface of the adhesin domain distal to the pilin domain reveals a depression consisting of conserved residues including Arg(181), previously shown to be necessary for erythrocyte adhesion. Mutational analysis revealed a cluster of conserved, positively charged residues that are required for CFA/I-mediated hemagglutination, implicating this as the receptor-binding pocket. Mutations in a few subclass-specific residues that surround the cluster displayed differential effects on the two red cell species used in hemagglutination, suggesting that these residues play a role in host or cell specificity. The C-terminal donor strand derived from the major subunit CfaB is folded as a beta-strand and fits into a hydrophobic groove in the pilin domain to complete the immunoglobulin fold. The location of this well ordered donor strand suggests the positioning and orientation of the subjacent major fimbrial subunit CfaB in the native assembly of CFA/I fimbriae.},

abstract = {Bacterial adhesion organelles, known as fimbria or pili, are expressed by gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria families. These appendages play a key role in the first steps of the invasion and infection processes, and they therefore provide bacteria with pathogenic abilities. To improve the knowledge of pili-mediated bacterial adhesion to host cells and how these pili behave under the presence of an external force, we first characterize, using force measuring optical tweezers, open coil-like T4 pili expressed by gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae with respect to their biomechanical properties. It is shown that their elongation behavior can be well described by the worm-like chain model and that they possess a large degree of flexibility. Their properties are then compared with those of helix-like pili expressed by gram-negative uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which have different pili architecture. The differences suggest that these two types of pili have distinctly dissimilar mechanisms to adhere and sustain external forces. Helix-like pili expressed by UPEC bacteria adhere to host cells by single adhesins located at the distal end of the pili while their helix-like structures act as shock absorbers to dampen the irregularly shear forces induced by urine flow and to increase the cooperativity of the pili ensemble, whereas open coil-like pili expressed by S. pneumoniae adhere to cells by a multitude of adhesins distributed along the pili. It is hypothesized that these two types of pili represent different strategies of adhering to host cells in the presence of external forces. When exposed to significant forces, bacteria expressing helix-like pili remain attached by distributing the external force among a multitude of pili, whereas bacteria expressing open coil-like pili sustain large forces primarily by their multitude of binding adhesins which presumably detach sequentially.},

In commercial broiler operations, APEC infections are controlled indirectly by vaccination against other respiratory diseases and minimizing stress conditions, and directly by administration of antimicrobial agents to suppress the infection in already infected flocks. The fact that most APEC strains possess some common virulence factors suggests that an effective vaccine against APEC is a viable option. The most important virulence factors that have been investigated over the years include type I and P fimbriae, aerobactin iron-acquisition system, and serum resistance traits. Despite the potential for developing an efficacious vaccine to combat this economically important poultry disease, several obstacles hinder such efforts. Those obstacles include the cost, vaccine delivery method and timing of vaccination as the birds should be immune to APEC by 21 days of age. Herein, we review the various attempts to develop an effective vaccine against the respiratory form of APEC diseases in poultry. We also discuss in-depth the potentials and limitations of such vaccines.},

We introduce the application of in-line digital holographic microscopy as a viable tool for measuring distributions of dense micrometer (3.2 microm) and submicrometer (0.75 microm) particles in a liquid solution with large depths of 1-10 mm. By recording a magnified hologram, we obtain a depth of field of approximately 1000 times the object diameter and a reduced depth of focus of approximately 10 particle diameters, both representing substantial improvements compared to a conventional microscope and in-line holography. Quantitative information on depth of field, depth of focus, and axial resolution is provided. We demonstrate that digital holographic microscopy can resolve the locations of several thousand particles and can measure their motions and trajectories using cinematographic holography. A sample trajectory and detailed morphological information of a free-swimming copepod nauplius are presented.},

abstract = {2G12 is one of only a few cloned antibodies with broadly neutralizing specificity to HIV-1 envelope proteins. Crystallographic and electron microscopic (EM) data showed that the Fab arms are locked together via a novel VH domain exchange. Both the conventional and the unprecedented additional VH-VH antigen binding sites show specificity for high mannose oligosaccharides on the silent face of gp120. We have now extended the EM and biochemical analysis of 2G12. Unligated 2G12 IgG1 molecules clearly show paired (parallel attached) Fab arms in the "doughnut" configuration attached to the Fc both in individual and computationally averaged images. A minority of the IgG molecules in the 2G12 prep showed the open "Y" configuration of conventional IgG. The averaged EM image compares well to the atomic structure model of 2G12. Papain digests of 2G12 yielded paired Fab arms (Fab dimer), as observed by EM, which dissociated into Fab-sized fragments in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Purified 2G12 reduced and alkylated H and L chains can reassociate to form IgG molecules with the Fab dimer configuration and can combine with L and H chains from conventional human IgG to form hybrid molecules. 2G12 is heavily aggregated following brief acid exposure possibly as a result of its unique structure. A model of the aggregation process is proposed. An anti-Id MAb was shown by EM to react with neither the conventional nor additional antigen binding sites, but bound to the lateral faces of the Fab arms of intact, reduced and alkylated, and reconstructed 2G12 molecules. Efforts to identify IgG molecules with a similar intertwined Fab dimer structure in a large IgG pool were unsuccessful.},

abstract = {The mucosal surface is the largest route through which pathogens enter the human body. To control the outbreak of mucosal infectious diseases, we must use our knowledge of the mucosal immune system to create vaccines that elicit protective mucosal and systemic immunity. Mucosal vaccines have advantages over traditional injectable vaccines in that they not only induce effective mucosal immune responses, but they also do not cause physical or psychological discomfort. Mucosal vaccines currently licensed for human use include oral vaccines against Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, poliovirus and rotavirus, and nasal vaccines against influenza virus. To further improve the existing vaccines, it will be necessary to develop novel vaccine production, storage and delivery systems through innovative strategies derived from interdisciplinary scientific research. Our accumulated knowledge of the innate and acquired arms of the mucosal immune system and the recent scientific and technical advancements in the fields of molecular biology, plant biology, bio-engineering and chemical engineering, genome biology and systems biology have created a unique research and development platform for the development of the next generation of mucosal vaccines. This review summarizes the current perspectives and future directions of mucosal vaccine development with emphasis on oral and nasal vaccines for the control of infectious diseases.},

The study demonstrates that the molecular fingerprint insight provided by Raman analysis holds great promise for distinguishing between healthy and diseased cells in the field of biomedicine. Herein a Raman Tweezers system has been applied to investigate the effects of thalassemia, a blood disease quite diffuse in the Mediterranean Sea region. By resonant excitation of hemoglobin Raman bands, we examined the oxygenation capability of normal, alpha- and beta-thalassemic erythrocytes. A reduction of this fundamental red blood cell function, particularly severe for beta-thalassemia, has been found. Raman spectroscopy was also used to draw hemoglobin distribution inside single erythrocytes; the results confirmed the characteristic anomaly (target shape), occurring in thalassemia and some other blood disorders. The success of resonance Raman spectroscopy for thalassemia detection reported in this review provide an interesting starting point to explore the application of a Raman Tweezers system in the analysis of several blood disorders.},

abstract = {S fimbrial adhesins (Sfa), which are able to recognize sialic acid-containing receptors on eukaryotic cells, are produced by Escherichia coli strains causing urinary tract infections or newborn meningitis. We recently described the cloning and molecular characterization of a determinant, termed sfaI, from the chromosome of an E. coli urinary tract infection strain. Here we present data concerning a S fimbria-specific gene cluster, designated sfaII, of an E. coli newborn meningitis strain. Like the SfaI complex, SfaII consists of the major subunit protein SfaA (16 kDa) and the minor subunit proteins SfaG (17 kDa), SfaS (15 kDa), and SfaH (29 kDa). The genes encoding the subunit proteins of SfaII were identified and sequenced. Their protein sequences were calculated from the DNA sequences and compared with those of the SfaI complex subunits. Although the sequences of the two major SfaA subunits differed markedly, the sequences of the minor subunits showed only a few amino acid exchanges (SfaG, SfaH) or were completely identical (SfaS). The introduction of a site-specific mutation into the gene sfaSII and subsequent analysis of an SfaS-negative clone indicated that sfaSII codes for the sialic acid-specific adhesin of the meninigitis isolate. These data were confirmed by the isolation and characterization of the SfaSII protein and the determination of its N-terminal amino acid sequence. The identity between the sialic acid-specific adhesins of SfaI and SfaII revealed that differences between the two Sfa complexes with respect to their capacities to agglutinate erythrocytes must result from sequence alterations of subunit proteins other than SfaS.},

abstract = {In most environments, such as natural aquatic systems, bacteria are found predominantly in self-organized sessile communities known as biofilms. In the presence of a significant flow, mature multispecies biofilms often develop into long filamentous structures called streamers, which can greatly influence ecosystem processes by increasing transient storage and cycling of nutrients. However, the interplay between hydrodynamic stresses and streamer formation is still unclear. Here, we show that suspended thread-like biofilms steadily develop in zigzag microchannels with different radii of curvature. Numerical simulations of a low-Reynolds-number flow around these corners indicate the presence of a secondary vortical motion whose intensity is related to the bending angle of the turn. We demonstrate that the formation of streamers is directly proportional to the intensity of the secondary flow around the corners. In addition, we show that a model of an elastic filament in a two-dimensional corner flow is able to explain how the streamers can cross fluid streamlines and connect corners located at the opposite sides of the channel.},

abstract = {Optical tweezers (infrared laser-based optical traps) have emerged as a powerful tool in molecular and cell biology. However, their usefulness has been limited, particularly in vivo, by the potential for damage to specimens resulting from the trapping laser. Relatively little is known about the origin of this phenomenon. Here we employed a wavelength-tunable optical trap in which the microscope objective transmission was fully characterized throughout the near infrared, in conjunction with a sensitive, rotating bacterial cell assay. Single cells of Escherichia coli were tethered to a glass coverslip by means of a single flagellum: such cells rotate at rates proportional to their transmembrane proton potential (Manson et al.,1980. J. Mol. Biol. 138:541-561). Monitoring the rotation rates of cells subjected to laser illumination permits a rapid and quantitative measure of their metabolic state. Employing this assay, we characterized photodamage throughout the near-infrared region favored for optical trapping (790-1064 nm). The action spectrum for photodamage exhibits minima at 830 and 970 nm, and maxima at 870 and 930 nm. Damage was reduced to background levels under anaerobic conditions, implicating oxygen in the photodamage pathway. The intensity dependence for photodamage was linear, supporting a single-photon process. These findings may help guide the selection of lasers and experimental protocols best suited for optical trapping work.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Migration is an important virulence factor for intestinal bacteria. However, the role of bacterial mobility in the penetration of viscous mucus and their spatial organization within the colon is relatively unknown. METHODS: Movements of fecal bacteria were assessed in gels of varying agarose concentrations and were compared with patterns of bacterial distribution observed in colons from conventional and Enterobacter cloacae-monoassociated mice. Bacteria were visualized using fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Long curly bacteria moved best in moderate viscosity gels, short rods and cocci preferred a low viscous environment, whereas high viscosity immobilized all bacterial groups. The spatial distribution of bacteria in the murine colon was also shape- and not taxonomy-dependent, indicating the existence of vertical (surface to lumen) and longitudinal (proximal to distal colon) viscosity gradients within the mucus layer. Our results suggest that mucus viscosity is low in goblet cells, at the crypt basis and close to the intestinal lumen, whereas sites adjacent to the columnar epithelium have a high mucus viscosity. The mucus viscosity increased progressively toward the distal colon, separating bacteria selectively in the proximal colon and completely in the distal colon. CONCLUSIONS: The site-specific regulation of mucus secretion and dehydration make the mucus layer firm and impenetrable for bacteria in regions close to the intestinal mucosa but loose and lubricating in regions adjacent to the luminal contents. Selective control of mucus secretion and dehydration may prove to be a key factor in the management of chronic diseases in which intestinal pathogens are involved.},

abstract = {Detailed analyses of the mechanisms that mediate binding of the uropathogenic Escherichia coli to host cells are essential, as attachment is a prerequisite for the subsequent infection process. We explore, by means of force measuring optical tweezers, the interaction between the galabiose receptor and the adhesin PapG expressed by P pili on single bacterial cells. Two variants of dynamic force spectroscopy were applied based on constant and non-linear loading force. The specific PapG-galabiose binding showed typical slip-bond behaviour in the force interval (30-100 pN) set by the pilus intrinsic biomechanical properties. Moreover, it was found that the bond has a thermodynamic off-rate and a bond length of 2.6 x 10(-3) s(-1) and 5.0 A, respectively. Consequently, the PapG-galabiose complex is significantly stronger than the internal bonds in the P pilus structure that stabilizes the helical chain-like macromolecule. This finding suggests that the specific binding is strong enough to enable the P pili rod to unfold when subjected to strong shear forces in the urinary tract. The unfolding process of the P pili rod promotes the formation of strong multipili interaction, which is important for the bacterium to maintain attachment to the host cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reliable and timely information on the leading causes of death in populations, and how these are changing, is a crucial input into health policy debates. In the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2010 (GBD 2010), we aimed to estimate annual deaths for the world and 21 regions between 1980 and 2010 for 235 causes, with uncertainty intervals (UIs), separately by age and sex.

METHODS: We attempted to identify all available data on causes of death for 187 countries from 1980 to 2010 from vital registration, verbal autopsy, mortality surveillance, censuses, surveys, hospitals, police records, and mortuaries. We assessed data quality for completeness, diagnostic accuracy, missing data, stochastic variations, and probable causes of death. We applied six different modelling strategies to estimate cause-specific mortality trends depending on the strength of the data. For 133 causes and three special aggregates we used the Cause of Death Ensemble model (CODEm) approach, which uses four families of statistical models testing a large set of different models using different permutations of covariates. Model ensembles were developed from these component models. We assessed model performance with rigorous out-of-sample testing of prediction error and the validity of 95{\%} UIs. For 13 causes with low observed numbers of deaths, we developed negative binomial models with plausible covariates. For 27 causes for which death is rare, we modelled the higher level cause in the cause hierarchy of the GBD 2010 and then allocated deaths across component causes proportionately, estimated from all available data in the database. For selected causes (African trypanosomiasis, congenital syphilis, whooping cough, measles, typhoid and parathyroid, leishmaniasis, acute hepatitis E, and HIV/AIDS), we used natural history models based on information on incidence, prevalence, and case-fatality. We separately estimated cause fractions by aetiology for diarrhoea, lower respiratory infections, and meningitis, as well as disaggregations by subcause for chronic kidney disease, maternal disorders, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. For deaths due to collective violence and natural disasters, we used mortality shock regressions. For every cause, we estimated 95{\%} UIs that captured both parameter estimation uncertainty and uncertainty due to model specification where CODEm was used. We constrained cause-specific fractions within every age-sex group to sum to total mortality based on draws from the uncertainty distributions.

FINDINGS: In 2010, there were 52·8 million deaths globally. At the most aggregate level, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes were 24·9{\%} of deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 15·9 million (34·1{\%}) of 46·5 million in 1990. This decrease was largely due to decreases in mortality from diarrhoeal disease (from 2·5 to 1·4 million), lower respiratory infections (from 3·4 to 2·8 million), neonatal disorders (from 3·1 to 2·2 million), measles (from 0·63 to 0·13 million), and tetanus (from 0·27 to 0·06 million). Deaths from HIV/AIDS increased from 0·30 million in 1990 to 1·5 million in 2010, reaching a peak of 1·7 million in 2006. Malaria mortality also rose by an estimated 19·9{\%} since 1990 to 1·17 million deaths in 2010. Tuberculosis killed 1·2 million people in 2010. Deaths from non-communicable diseases rose by just under 8 million between 1990 and 2010, accounting for two of every three deaths (34·5 million) worldwide by 2010. 8 million people died from cancer in 2010, 38{\%} more than two decades ago; of these, 1·5 million (19{\%}) were from trachea, bronchus, and lung cancer. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke collectively killed 12·9 million people in 2010, or one in four deaths worldwide, compared with one in five in 1990; 1·3 million deaths were due to diabetes, twice as many as in 1990. The fraction of global deaths due to injuries (5·1 million deaths) was marginally higher in 2010 (9·6{\%}) compared with two decades earlier (8·8{\%}). This was driven by a 46{\%} rise in deaths worldwide due to road traffic accidents (1·3 million in 2010) and a rise in deaths from falls. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lower respiratory infections, lung cancer, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of death in 2010. Ischaemic heart disease, lower respiratory infections, stroke, diarrhoeal disease, malaria, and HIV/AIDS were the leading causes of years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) in 2010, similar to what was estimated for 1990, except for HIV/AIDS and preterm birth complications. YLLs from lower respiratory infections and diarrhoea decreased by 45-54{\%} since 1990; ischaemic heart disease and stroke YLLs increased by 17-28{\%}. Regional variations in leading causes of death were substantial. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes still accounted for 76{\%} of premature mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2010. Age standardised death rates from some key disorders rose (HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease in particular), but for most diseases, death rates fell in the past two decades; including major vascular diseases, COPD, most forms of cancer, liver cirrhosis, and maternal disorders. For other conditions, notably malaria, prostate cancer, and injuries, little change was noted.

INTERPRETATION: Population growth, increased average age of the world's population, and largely decreasing age-specific, sex-specific, and cause-specific death rates combine to drive a broad shift from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes towards non-communicable diseases. Nevertheless, communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes remain the dominant causes of YLLs in sub-Saharan Africa. Overlaid on this general pattern of the epidemiological transition, marked regional variation exists in many causes, such as interpersonal violence, suicide, liver cancer, diabetes, cirrhosis, Chagas disease, African trypanosomiasis, melanoma, and others. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of sound epidemiological assessments of the causes of death on a regular basis.

abstract = {Rapid and accurate diagnosis for pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility is critical for controlling bacterial infections. Conventional methods for determining bacterium's sensitivity to antibiotic depend mostly on measuring the change of microbial proliferation in response to the drug. Such "biological assay" inevitably takes time, ranging from days for fast-growing bacteria to weeks for slow-growers. Here, a novel tool has been developed to detect the "chemical features" of bacterial cell wall that enables rapid identification of drug resistant bacteria within hours. The surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) technique based on our newly developed SERS-active substrate was applied to assess the fine structures of the bacterial cell wall. The SERS profiles recorded by such a platform are sensitive and stable, that could readily reflect different bacterial cell walls found in Gram-positive, Gram-negative, or mycobacteria groups. Moreover, characteristic changes in SERS profile were noticed in the drug-sensitive bacteria at the early period (i.e., approximately 1 hr) of antibiotic exposure, which could be used to differentiate them from the drug-resistant ones. The SERS-based diagnosis could be applied to a single bacterium. The high-speed SERS detection represents a novel approach for microbial diagnostics. The single-bacterium detection capability of SERS makes possible analyses directly on clinical specimen instead of pure cultured bacteria.},

abstract = {The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi exists in nature in an enzootic cycle that involves the arthropod vector Ixodes scapularis and mammalian reservoirs. To disseminate within and between these hosts, spirochetes must migrate through complex, polymeric environments such as the basement membrane of the tick midgut and the dermis of the mammal. To date, most research on the motility of B. burgdorferi has been done in media that do not resemble the tissue milieus that B. burgdorferi encounter in vivo. Here we show that the motility of Borrelia in gelatin matrices in vitro resembles the pathogen's movements in the chronically infected mouse dermis imaged by intravital microscopy. More specifically, B. burgdorferi motility in mouse dermis and gelatin is heterogeneous, with the bacteria transitioning between at least three different motility states that depend on transient adhesions to the matrix. We also show that B. burgdorferi is able to penetrate matrices with pore sizes much smaller than the diameter of the bacterium. We find a complex relationship between the swimming behavior of B. burgdorferi and the rheological properties of the gelatin, which cannot be accounted for by recent theoretical predictions for microorganism swimming in gels. Our results also emphasize the importance of considering borrelial adhesion as a dynamic rather than a static process.},

@article{Dai1999a,
abstract = {Membrane tension has been proposed to be important in regulating cell functions such as endocytosis and cell motility. The apparent membrane tension has been calculated from tether forces measured with laser tweezers. Both membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion and membrane tension contribute to the tether force. Separation of the plasma membrane from the cytoskeleton occurs in membrane blebs, which could remove the membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion term. In renal epithelial cells, tether forces are significantly lower on blebs than on membranes that are supported by cytoskeleton. Furthermore, the tether forces are equal on apical and basolateral blebs. In contrast, tether forces from membranes supported by the cytoskeleton are greater in apical than in basolateral regions, which is consistent with the greater apparent cytoskeletal density in the apical region. We suggest that the tether force on blebs primarily contains only the membrane tension term and that the membrane tension may be uniform over the cell surface. Additional support for this hypothesis comes from observations of melanoma cells that spontaneously bleb. In melanoma cells, tether forces on blebs are proportional to the radius of the bleb, and as large blebs form, there are spikes in the tether force in other cell regions. We suggest that an internal osmotic pressure inflates the blebs, and the pressure calculated from the Law of Laplace is similar to independent measurements of intracellular pressures. When the membrane tension term is subtracted from the apparent membrane tension over the cytoskeleton, the membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion term can be estimated. In both cell systems, membrane-cytoskeleton adhesion was the major factor in generating the tether force.},

abstract = {An experimental instrument for measuring a laser-induced fluorescence spectrum from a single aerosol particle is described. As a demonstration of instrument capabilities, the results of monodisperse 4.7 microm sodium chloride particles doped with fluorescent riboflavin, produced with an inkjet aerosol generator, are presented. The fluorescence of the aerosol particles is excited in the wide range from 210 to 419 nm using a pulsed, tunable optical parametric oscillator laser. The maximum of the fluorescence emission of separately measured particles is detected at 560 nm. The dependence of the fluorescence on the excitation wavelength is studied and fluorescence cross sections are estimated. Agreement between the measured fluorescence data and the literature data for riboflavin is observed.},

abstract = {P pili are multisubunit fibers essential for the attachment of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to the kidney. These fibers are formed by the noncovalent assembly of six different homologous subunit types in an array that is strictly defined in terms of both the number and order of each subunit type. Assembly occurs through a mechanism termed "donor-strand exchange (DSE)" in which an N-terminal extension (Nte) of one subunit donates a beta-strand to an adjacent subunit, completing its Ig fold. Despite structural determination of the different subunits, the mechanism determining specificity of subunit ordering in pilus assembly remained unclear. Here, we have used noncovalent mass spectrometry to monitor DSE between all 30 possible pairs of P pilus subunits and their Ntes. We demonstrate a striking correlation between the natural order of subunits in pili and their ability to undergo DSE in vitro. The results reveal insights into the molecular mechanism by which subunit ordering during the assembly of this complex is achieved.},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a number of experimental studies convincingly demonstrating that a suspension of self-propelled bacteria (microswimmers in general) may have an effective viscosity significantly smaller than the viscosity of the ambient fluid. This is in sharp contrast with suspensions of hard passive inclusions, whose presence always increases the viscosity. Here we present a 2D model for a suspension of microswimmers in a fluid and analyze it analytically in the dilute regime (no swimmer-swimmer interactions) and numerically using a Mimetic Finite Difference discretization. Our analysis shows that in the dilute regime (in the absence of rotational diffusion) the effective shear viscosity is not affected by self-propulsion. But at the moderate concentrations (due to swimmer-swimmer interactions) the effective viscosity decreases linearly as a function of the propulsion strength of the swimmers. These findings prove that (i) a physically observable decrease of viscosity for a suspension of self-propelled microswimmers can be explained purely by hydrodynamic interactions and (ii) self-propulsion and interaction of swimmers are both essential to the reduction of the effective shear viscosity. We also performed a number of numerical experiments analyzing the dynamics of swimmers resulting from pairwise interactions. The numerical results agree with the physically observed phenomena (e.g., attraction of swimmer to swimmer and swimmer to the wall). This is viewed as an additional validation of the model and the numerical scheme.},

abstract = {In optical tweezers, thermal drift is detrimental for highr-esolution measurements. In particular, absorption of the trapping laser light by the microscope objective that focuses the beam leads to heating of the objective and subsequent drift. This entails long equilibration times which may limit sensitive biophysical assays. Here, we introduce an objective temperature feedback system for minimizing thermal drift. We measured that the infrared laser heated the objective by 0.7K per watt of laser power and that the laser focus moved relative to the sample by approximately 1 nm/mK due to thermal expansion of the objective. The feedback stabilized the temperature of the trapping objective with millikelvin precision. This enhanced the long-term temperature stability and significantly reduced the settling time of the instrument to about 100 s after a temperature disturbance while preserving single DNA base-pair resolution of surface-coupled assays. Minimizing systematic temperature changes of the objective and concurrent drift is of interest for other high-resolution microscopy techniques. Furthermore, temperature control is often a desirable parameter in biophysical experiments.},

abstract = {Mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis have become an increasingly important subject as pathogens have become increasingly resistant to current antibiotics. The adhesion of microorganisms to the surface of host tissue is often a first step in pathogenesis and is a plausible target for new antiinfective agents. Examination of bacterial adhesion has been difficult both because it is polyvalent and because bacterial adhesins often recognize more than one type of cell-surface molecule. This paper describes an experimental procedure that measures the forces of adhesion resulting from the interaction of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to molecularly well defined models of cellular surfaces. This procedure uses self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to model the surface of epithelial cells and optical tweezers to manipulate the bacteria. Optical tweezers orient the bacteria relative to the surface and, thus, limit the number of points of attachment (that is, the valency of attachment). Using this combination, it was possible to quantify the force required to break a single interaction between pilus and mannose groups linked to the SAM. These results demonstrate the deconvolution and characterization of complicated events in microbial adhesion in terms of specific molecular interactions. They also suggest that the combination of optical tweezers and appropriately functionalized SAMs is a uniquely synergistic system with which to study polyvalent adhesion of bacteria to biologically relevant surfaces and with which to screen for inhibitors of this adhesion.},

abstract = {When cell receptors bind to immobilized ligands, the resulting bond can be subjected to tensile mechanical force. This might be expected to shorten bond lifetimes. However, cells from bacteria to blood cells express receptors that are activated by tensile force to form longer-lived bonds, referred to as catch bonds. The process of catch bond activation involves non-equilibrium processes that are poorly probed by experimental and computational structural methods alike. However, I argue here that the preponderance of data indicates that force acts on an interdomain region which regulates the conformation of a distal ligand-binding site, in a process closely related to mechanochemistry and allosteric regulation.},

abstract = {We have developed an integrated laser trap/flow control video microscope for mechanical manipulation of single biopolymers. The instrument is automated to maximize experimental throughput. A single-beam optical trap capable of trapping micron-scale polystyrene beads in the middle of a 200-microm-deep microchamber is used, making it possible to insert a micropipette inside this chamber to hold a second bead by suction. Together, these beads function as easily exchangeable surfaces between which macromolecules of interest can be attached. A computer-controlled flow system is used to exchange the liquid in the chamber and to establish a flow rate with high precision. The flow and the optical trap can be used to exert forces on the beads, the displacements of which can be measured either by video microscopy or by laser deflection. To test the performance of this instrument, individual biotinylated DNA molecules were assembled between two streptavidin beads, and the DNA elasticity was characterized using both laser trap and flow forces. DNA extension under varying forces was measured by video microscopy. The combination of the flow system and video microscopy is a versatile design that is particularly useful for the study of systems susceptible to laser-induced damage. This capability was demonstrated by following the translocation of transcribing RNA polymerase up to 650 s.},

abstract = {Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) express various kinds of organelles, so-called pili or fimbriae, that mediate adhesion to host tissue in the urinary tract through specific receptor-adhesin interactions. The biomechanical properties of these pili have been considered important for the ability of bacteria to withstand shear forces from rinsing urine flows. Force-measuring optical tweezers have been used to characterize individual organelles of F1C type expressed by UPEC bacteria with respect to such properties. Qualitatively, the force-versus-elongation response was found to be similar to that of other types of helix-like pili expressed by UPEC, i.e., type 1, P, and S, with force-induced elongation in three regions, one of which represents the important uncoiling mechanism of the helix-like quaternary structure. Quantitatively, the steady-state uncoiling force was assessed as 26.4 ±1.4 pN, which is similar to those of other pili (which range from 21 pN for S(I) to 30 pN for type 1). The corner velocity for dynamic response (1,400 nm/s) was found to be larger than those of the other pili (400-700 nm/s for S and P pili, and 6 nm/s for type 1). The kinetics were found to be faster, with a thermal opening rate of 17 Hz, a few times higher than S and P pili, and three orders of magnitude higher than type 1. These data suggest that F1C pili are, like P and S pili, evolutionarily selected to primarily withstand the conditions expressed in the upper urinary tract.},

The vaccine preparations consisted of recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and various amounts of formalin-killed whole bacteria expressing the most prevalent colonization factor antigens (CFAs). Significant immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses against CTB and the various CFA components were seen in a majority of volunteers after two doses of ETEC vaccine independent of the vaccine lot given. The IgA ASC responses against CTB were significantly higher after the second than after the first immunization, whereas the CFA-specific IgA ASC responses were almost comparable after the first and second doses of ETEC vaccine. Two immunizations with one-third of a full dose of CFA-ETEC bacteria induced lower frequencies of IgA ASC responses against all the different CFAs than two full vaccine doses, i.e., 63 versus 80{\%} for CFA/I, 56 versus 70{\%} for CS1, 31 versus 65{\%} for CS2, and 56 versus 75{\%} for CS4. The proportion of vaccinees responding with rises in the titer of serum IgA antibody against the various CFA antigens was also lower after immunization with the reduced dose of CFA-ETEC bacteria. These findings suggest that measurements of circulating IgA ASCs can be used not only for qualitative but also for quantitative assessments of the immunogenicity of individual fimbrial antigens in various preparations of ETEC vaccine.},

Infection with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) carrying CS3 alone or CS1 plus CS3 induced diarrhea in most (80{\%}) of the rabbits, whereas nonenterotoxigenic strains expressing CS1 or CS2 rarely induced diarrhea. Strains carrying CS1, CS2, or CS3 alone were all shed in stools for a significantly longer period than normal fecal flora-type E. coli. Initial infection with ETEC positive for CS1 plus CS3 induced significant protection against disease caused by reinfection with a highly diarrheagenic dose of the homologous strain; rabbits previously infected with serotype-heterologous, nontoxigenic bacteria carrying CS1 only were also protected against this challenge, whereas no such protection was induced by serogroup-homologous E. coli carrying CS2 only. Animals previously infected with CS1-, CS3-, or CS1-plus-CS3-positive bacteria excreted the CS1-plus-CS3 challenge strain for a significantly shorter period than did "nonimmunized" rabbits, whereas initial infection with bacteria carrying CS2 only did not result in such reduced shedding. Monoclonal antibodies against CS1, CS2, or CS3 all protected against experimental infection with ETEC carrying the corresponding CS factor. These results suggest that all the subcomponents of colonization factor antigen II are colonization factors and may induce anticolonization immunity.},

abstract = {Tethers were created between a living Escherichia coli bacterium and a bead by unspecifically attaching the bead to the outer membrane and pulling it away using optical tweezers. Upon release, the bead returned to the bacterium, thus showing the existence of an elastic tether between the bead and the bacterium. These tethers can be tens of microns long, several times the bacterial length. Using mutants expressing different parts of the outer membrane structure, we have shown that an intact core lipopolysaccharide is a necessary condition for tether formation, regardless of whether the beads were uncoated polystyrene or beads coated with lectin. A physical characterization of the tethers has been performed yielding visco-elastic tether force-extension relationships: for first pull tethers, a spring constant of 10-12 pN/mum describes the tether visco-elasticity, for subsequent pulls the spring constant decreases to 6-7 pN/mum, and typical relaxation timescales of hundreds of seconds are observed. Studies of tether stability in the presence of proteases, lipases, and amylases lead us to propose that the extracted tether is primarily composed of the asymmetric lipopolysaccharide containing bilayer of the outer membrane. This unspecific tethered attachment mechanism could be important in the initiation of bacterial adhesion.},

abstract = {The animal cell cytoskeleton consists of three interconnected filament systems: actin microfilaments, microtubules and the lesser known intermediate filaments (IFs). All mature IF proteins share a common tripartite domain structure and the ability to assemble into 8-12nm wide filaments. At the time of their discovery in the 1980s, IFs were only considered as passive elements of the cytoskeleton mainly involved in maintaining the mechanical integrity of tissues. Since then, our knowledge of IFs structure, assembly plan and functions has improved dramatically. Especially, single IFs show a unique combination of extensibility, flexibility and toughness that is a direct consequence of their unique assembly plan. In this review we will first discuss the mechanical design of IFs by combining the experimental data with recent multi-scale modeling results. Then we will discuss how mechanical forces may interact with IFs in vivo both directly and through the activation of other proteins such as kinases.},

abstract = {Beyond covalent connections within protein and lipid molecules, weak noncovalent interactions between large molecules govern properties of cellular structure and interfacial adhesion in biology. These bonds and structures have limited lifetimes and so will fail under any level of force if pulled on for the right length of time. As such, the strength of interaction is the level of force most likely to disrupt a bond on a particular time scale. For instance, strength is zero on time scales longer than the natural lifetime for spontaneous dissociation. On the other hand, if driven to unbind or change structure on time scales shorter than needed for diffusive relaxation, strength will reach an adiabatic limit set by the maximum gradient in a potential of mean force. Over the enormous span of time scales between spontaneous dissociation and adiabatic detachment, theory predicts that bond breakage under steadily rising force occurs most frequently at a force determined by the rate of loading. Moreover, the continuous plot (spectrum) of strength expressed on a scale of loge(loading rate) provides a map of the prominent barriers traversed in the energy landscape along the force-driven pathway and reveals the differences in energy between barriers. Illustrated with results from recent laboratory measurements, dynamic strength spectra provide a new view into the inner complexity of receptor-ligand interactions and receptor lipid anchoring.},

abstract = {Urinary tract infections (UTI) are among the most common bacterial infections in humans. Symptomatic UTIs may be acute, recurrent or chronic but the most frequent form of UTI is asymptomatic bacteruria (ABU). In ABU, the mucosa remains inert, despite the presence of large bacterial numbers in urine. The difference in disease severity reflects the virulence of the infecting strain and the propensity of the host to respond to infection. It is essential to understand the molecular basis of disease diversity and the molecular interactions between bacteria and host that determine asymptomatic carriage and the transition to disease. We discuss the initial interactions between bacteria and the mucosal surfaces in the human urinary tract, and the bacterial factors involved in the breach of mucosal inertia. Specifically, the contribution of P and type 1 fimbriae to bacterial establishment and host response induction are investigated. The results show that P fimbriae serve as independent virulence factors when expressed by an ABU strain, by promoting the establishment of bacteriuria and the innate host response, which is the cause of symptoms and tissue damage. P fimbriae thus fulfil the molecular Koch postulates as independent virulence factors in the human urinary tract. Type 1 fimbriae, in contrast, did not act as virulence factors in this model, and thus appear to serve a different function in man than in the murine model.},

abstract = {A cell-scaled microbead system was used to analyze the force-dependent kinetics of P-selectin adhesive bonds independent of micromechanical properties of the neutrophil's surface microvilli, an elastic structure on which P-selectin ligand glycoprotein-1 (PSGL-1) is localized. Microvillus extension has been hypothesized in contributing to the dynamic range of leukocyte rolling observed in vivo during inflammatory processes. To evaluate PSGL-1/P-selectin bond kinetics of microbeads and neutrophils, rolling and tethering on P-selectin-coated substrates were compared in a parallel-plate flow chamber. The dissociation rates for PSGL-1 microbeads on P-selectin were briefer than those of neutrophils for any wall shear stress, and increased more rapidly with increasing flow. The microvillus length necessary to reconcile dissociation constants of PSGL-1 microbeads and neutrophils on P-selectin was 0.21 microm at 0.4 dyn/cm2, and increased to 1.58 microm at 2 dyn/cm2. The apparent elastic spring constant of the microvillus ranged from 1340 to 152 pN/microm at 0.4 and 2.0 dyn/cm2 wall shear stress. Scanning electron micrographs of neutrophils rolling on P-selectin confirmed the existence of micrometer-scaled tethers. Fixation of neutrophils to abrogate microvillus elasticity resulted in rolling behavior similar to PSGL-1 microbeads. Our results suggest that microvillus extension during transient PSGL-1/P-selectin bonding may enhance the robustness of neutrophil rolling interactions.},

The technique has been validated using charged spherical polystyrene beads. The excellent agreement of our results with the expected values demonstrates the quality of our procedure. We measured the charge of spores of B. subtilis purified from a wild type strain and from two isogenic mutants characterized by an altered spore surface. Our technique is able to discriminate the three spore types used, by their charge and by their hydrodynamic coefficient which is related to the hydrophobic properties of the spore surface.},

abstract = {To survive the harsh environment of a churning intestinal tract, bacteria attach to the host epithelium via thin fibers called pili (or fimbriae). Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli bacteria expressing colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) pili and related pili are the most common known bacterial cause of diarrheal disease, including traveler's diarrhea. CFA/I pili, assembled via the alternate chaperone pathway, are essential for binding and colonization of the small bowel by these pathogenic bacteria. Herein, we elucidate unique structural features of CFA/I pili that appear to optimize their function as bacterial tethers in the intestinal tract. Using transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained samples in combination with iterative three-dimensional helical reconstruction methods for image processing, we determined the structure of the CFA/I pilus filament. Our results indicate that strong end-to-end protein interactions and weak interactions between the coils of a sturdy spring-like helix provide the combination of strength, stability, and flexibility required to sustain bacterial adhesion and incite intestinal disease. We propose that CFA/I pili behave like a spring to maintain attachment to the gut lining during vortex mixing and downward flow of the intestinal contents, thereby persisting long enough for these bacteria to colonize the host epithelium and cause enteric disease.},

Type IV pili (Tfp) are required for twitching and social gliding, but the mechanism by which these filaments promote motility has remained enigmatic. Here we use laser tweezers to show that Tfp forcefully retract. Neisseria gonorrhoeae cells that produce Tfp actively crawl on a glass surface and form adherent microcolonies. When laser tweezers are used to place and hold cells near a microcolony, retractile forces pull the cells toward the microcolony. In quantitative experiments, the Tfp of immobilized bacteria bind to latex beads and retract, pulling beads from the tweezers at forces that can exceed 80 pN. Episodes of retraction terminate with release or breakage of the Tfp tether. Both motility and retraction mediated by Tfp occur at about 1 microm s(-1) and require protein synthesis and function of the PilT protein. Our experiments establish that Tfp filaments retract, generate substantial force and directly mediate cell movement.},

abstract = {Many types of bacterium express micrometer-long attachment organelles (so-called pili) whose role is to mediate adhesion to host tissue. Until recently, little was known about their function in the adhesion process. Force-measuring optical tweezers (FMOT) have since then been used to unravel the biomechanical properties of various types of pili, primarily those from uropathogenic E. coli, in particular their force-vs.-elongation response, but lately also some properties of the adhesin are situated at the distal end of the pilus. This knowledge provides an understanding of how piliated bacteria can sustain external shear forces caused by rinsing processes, e.g., urine flow. It has been found that many types of pilus exhibit unique and complex force-vs.-elongation responses. It has been conjectured that their dissimilar properties impose significant differences in their ability to sustain external forces and that different types of pilus therefore have dissimilar predisposition to withstand different types of rinsing conditions. An understanding of these properties is of high importance since it can serve as a basis for finding new means to combat bacterial adhesion, including that caused by antibiotic-resistance bacteria. This work presents a review of the current status of the assessment of biophysical properties of individual pili on single bacteria exposed to strain/stress, primarily by the FMOT technique. It also addresses, for the first time, how the elongation and retraction properties of the rod couple to the adhesive properties of the tip adhesin.},

In this paper, an efficient randomized algorithm (RCD) for detecting circles is presented, which is not based on the Hough transform (HT). Instead of using an accumulator for saving the information of the related parameters in the HT-based methods, the proposed RCD does not need an accumulator. The main concept used in the proposed RCD is that we first randomly select four edge pixels in the image and define a distance criterion to determine whether there is a possible circle in the image; after finding a possible circle, we apply an evidence-collecting process to further determine whether the possible circle is a true circle or not. Some synthetic images with different levels of noises and some realistic images containing circular objects with some occluded circles and missing edges have been taken to test the performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RCD is faster than other HT-based methods for the noise level between the light level and the modest level. For a heavy noise level, the randomized HT could be faster than the proposed RCD, but at the expense of massive memory requirements.},

Substantial advances in understanding the biology of human diseases have been made and tremendous benefit to patients has been gained with the first generation of therapeutic antibodies. The lessons learnt from these antibodies have provided the foundation for the discovery and development of future therapeutic antibodies. Here we review how key insights obtained from the development of therapeutic antibodies complemented by newer antibody engineering technologies are delivering a second generation of therapeutic antibodies with promise for greater clinical efficacy and safety.},

abstract = {Type 3 fimbriae are adhesive organelles found in enterobacterial pathogens. The fimbriae promote biofilm formation on biotic and abiotic surfaces; however, the exact identity of the receptor for the type 3 fimbriae adhesin, MrkD, remains elusive. We analyzed naturally occurring structural and functional variabilities of the MrkD adhesin from Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates of diverse origins. We identified a total of 33 allelic variants of mrkD among 90 K. pneumoniae isolates and 10 allelic variants among 608 E. coli isolates, encoding 11 and 9 protein variants, respectively. Based on the level of accumulated silent variability between the alleles, mrkD was acquired a relatively long time ago in K. pneumoniae but recently in E. coli. However, unlike K. pneumoniae, mrkD in E. coli is actively evolving under a strong positive selection by accumulation of mutations, often targeting the same positions in the protein. Several naturally occurring MrkD protein variants from E. coli were found to be significantly less adherent when tested in a mannan-binding assay and showed reduced biofilm-forming capacity. Functional examination of the MrkD adhesin in flow chamber experiments determined that it interacts with Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells in a shear-dependent manner, i.e., the binding is catch-bond-like and enhanced under increasing shear conditions. Homology modeling strongly suggested that MrkD has a two-domain structure, comprising a pilin domain anchoring the adhesin to the fimbrial shaft and a lectin domain containing the binding pocket; this is similar to structures found in other catch-bond-forming fimbrial adhesins in enterobacteria.},

abstract = {Ureteral peristaltic mechanism facilitates urine transport from the kidney to the bladder. Numerical analysis of the peristaltic flow in the ureter aims to further our understanding of the reflux phenomenon and other ureteral abnormalities. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) plays an important role in accuracy of this approach and the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is a strong method to analyze the coupled fluid-structure interaction between the compliant wall and the surrounding fluid. This formulation, however, was not used in previous studies of peristalsis in living organisms. In the present investigation, a numerical simulation is introduced and solved through ALE formulation to perform the ureteral flow and stress analysis. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are used as the governing equations for the fluid, and a linear elastic model is utilized for the compliant wall. The wall stimulation is modeled by nonlinear contact analysis using a rigid contact surface since an appropriate model for simulation of ureteral peristalsis needs to contain cell-to-cell wall stimulation. In contrast to previous studies, the wall displacements are not predetermined in the presented model of this finite-length compliant tube, neither the peristalsis needs to be periodic. Moreover, the temporal changes of ureteral wall intraluminal shear stress during peristalsis are included in our study. Iterative computing of two-way coupling is used to solve the governing equations. Two phases of nonperistaltic and peristaltic transport of urine in the ureter are discussed. Results are obtained following an analysis of the effects of the ureteral wall compliance, the pressure difference between the ureteral inlet and outlet, the maximum height of the contraction wave, the contraction wave velocity, and the number of contraction waves on the ureteral outlet flow. The results indicate that the proximal part of the ureter is prone to a higher shear stress during peristalsis compared with its middle and distal parts. It is also shown that the peristalsis is more efficient as the maximum height of the contraction wave increases. Finally, it is concluded that improper function of ureteropelvic junction results in the passage of part of urine back flow even in the case of slow start-up of the peristaltic contraction wave.},

abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the most common bacterial cause of diarrhoea in the world, annually affecting up to 400,000,000 children under 5 years of age living in developing countries (DCs). Although ETEC possesses numerous antigens, the relatively conserved colonization factor (CF) antigens and the heat labile enterotoxin (LT) have been associated with protection and most vaccine candidates have exploited these antigens. A safe and effective vaccine against ETEC is a feasible goal as supported by the acquisition of protective immunity. The success of an ETEC vaccine targeting infants and children in DCs will depend on a combination of maximally antigenic vaccine preparations and regimens for their delivery which will produce optimal immune responses to these antigens. Vaccine candidates having a high priority for accelerated development and clinical testing for eventual use in infants would include inactivated ETEC or Shigella hybrids expressing ETEC antigens as well as attenuated ETEC strains which express the major CF antigens and LT toxin B-subunit, as well as attenuated Shigella, Vibrio cholerae and Salmonella typhi hybrids engineered to deliver antigens of ETEC. Candidates for an ETEC vaccine would have to meet the minimal requirement of providing at least 50{\%} protection against severe disease in DCs during the first 2 years of life. The critical roadblock to achieving this goal has not been the science as much as the lack of a sufficiently funded and focused effort to bring it to realization. However, a Product Development Partnership to overcome this hurdle could accelerate the time lines towards when control of ETEC disease in DCs is substantially closer.},

abstract = {Why do bacteria have shape? Is morphology valuable or just a trivial secondary characteristic? Why should bacteria have one shape instead of another? Three broad considerations suggest that bacterial shapes are not accidental but are biologically important: cells adopt uniform morphologies from among a wide variety of possibilities, some cells modify their shape as conditions demand, and morphology can be tracked through evolutionary lineages. All of these imply that shape is a selectable feature that aids survival. The aim of this review is to spell out the physical, environmental, and biological forces that favor different bacterial morphologies and which, therefore, contribute to natural selection. Specifically, cell shape is driven by eight general considerations: nutrient access, cell division and segregation, attachment to surfaces, passive dispersal, active motility, polar differentiation, the need to escape predators, and the advantages of cellular differentiation. Bacteria respond to these forces by performing a type of calculus, integrating over a number of environmental and behavioral factors to produce a size and shape that are optimal for the circumstances in which they live. Just as we are beginning to answer how bacteria create their shapes, it seems reasonable and essential that we expand our efforts to understand why they do so.},

To quantitatively determine the relationship between poly (vinyl chloride) (PVC) surface properties and bacterial adhesion, we have compared attachment of slime-producing S. epidermidis strains on PVC and various coatings under flow conditions. Bacterial adhesion and colonization was quantified by counting the viable organisms on the adherent surface as well as by scanning electron microscopy, epifluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Fluorination of the PVC surface encourages S. epidermidis adhesion whereas; diamond-like carbon (DLC) and especially silver (Ag) coatings seem to inhibit its adhesion. In most materials, the number of adherent bacteria decreased with the increase of shear rate. These results indicate that bacterial adhesion is influenced by the chemical properties of the polymeric surfaces, the surface roughness and the associated flow conditions.},

These structures project from the outer membrane of Escherichia coli, and contain on their distal tip a thin fibrillum, 25 A in diameter and 150 A long, displaying an adhesin protein responsible for the binding of the bacterium to the surface of epithelial cells lining the urinary tract. Operationally, it is possible to identify three morphologically distinct states of the 68-A-diameter P-pili rods, based on the degree of curvature each can adopt. These states are designated "straight," "curved," and "highly curved." The rods can also be unwound to form thin "threads" that are very similar to the tip fibrillae. Electron microscope data are used to distinguish among these four morphological states and to define limits on the shapes of the pilus proteins. The mechanical properties of the PapA polymers are assessed, and implications of rod polymorphism for pilus function are discussed. A wide variety of data are considered in light of the possibility that all pilins are similar in molecular architecture, with specific differences designed to optimize their specialized functions in the pilus assembly.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Optical tweezers have revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world. Axial optical tweezers, which apply force to a surface-tethered molecule by directly moving either the trap or the stage along the laser beam axis, offer several potential benefits when studying a range of novel biophysical phenomena. This geometry, although it is conceptually straight- forward, suffers from aberrations that result in variation of the trap stiffness when the distance between the microscope coverslip and the trap focus is being changed. Many standard techniques, such as back-focal-plane interferometry, are difficult to employ in this geometry due to back-scattered light between the bead and the coverslip, whereas the noise inherent in a surface- tethered assay can severely limit the resolution of an experiment. Because of these complications, precision force spectroscopy measurements have adapted alternative geometries such as the highly successful dumbbell traps. In recent years, however, most of the difficulties inherent in constructing a precision axial optical tweezers have been solved. This review article aims to inform the reader about recent progress in axial optical trapping, as well as the potential for these devices to perform inno- vative biophysical measurements.},

Single-particle methods have been used with great success for the three-dimensional reconstruction of macromolecular assemblies that have no internal symmetry or closed point group symmetries. An approach is presented for the application of single-particle methods to helical filaments that surmounts many of the difficulties of helical image analysis, including indexing, unbending and the need to find long helically symmetric filament segments. It is shown using both human Rad51 and E. coli RecA nucleoprotein filaments that this approach converges without user intervention to a stable solution, and that it has the potential to overcome many of the problems associated with image analysis of disordered helical polymers. The method can be applied transparently to structures where Bessel overlap would greatly complicate helical analysis. In addition, the procedure allows for the ab initio determination of helical symmetry, when no prior knowledge exists.},

abstract = {Cells of the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli are able to attach to various host cells by means of a mannose-specific adhesin associated with type 1 fimbriae. Here we show that fragmentation of type 1 fimbriae by freezing and thawing results in increased mannose-binding activity as demonstrated by increased hemagglutination, increased stimulation of human lymphocyte proliferation, and increased binding of the mannose-containing enzyme horseradish peroxidase. Increased activity in all three assays was mannose sensitive and was not exhibited by FimH- mutant type 1 fimbriae lacking the adhesin. Scatchard analysis of the data from peroxidase binding assays showed that unfrozen and frozen fimbriae contain binding sites displaying two classes of affinity. Frozen and thawed fimbriae expressed an increase in the number of high-affinity binding sites. These results show that fragmentation of the fimbrial structure exposes cryptic mannose-binding activity associated with type 1 fimbriae, presumably that of internally located adhesin molecules. Our data support earlier observations that adhesin moieties of type 1 fimbriae are located both at the tips and at intervals along the length of the fimbriae. In addition, our data suggest that only the adhesin moieties that are located at the fimbrial tips are functional in binding mannose. Adhesins located along the length of the fimbriae have their mannose-binding activity buried within the fimbrial structure and hence are not functional. We propose an updated model for the structure of type 1 fimbriae that is in agreement with the above observations.},

Male human urothelium was treated for the immunohistochemical demonstration of secretory IgA (sIgA) in order to verify its own possible antimicrobial properties. An intense immunoreactivity for sIgA was observed in the apical cells of the urethral and vesical epithelia. The ureteric epithelium, at the luminal surface, showed discontinuous areas of less dense or completely absent reaction product. A less intense immunoreactivity was observed in the pelvic apical epithelial cells. The results suggest that sIgA play a prominent role in the local defence mechanisms of the lower urinary tract against ascending infections, whereas in the upper urinary tract the immuno-specific local defences seem reduced.},

abstract = {Abstract – Urinary system concerns with the excretion of urine, and the waste products of metabolism. The kidneys separate urea, mineral salts, toxins, and other waste products from the blood, and to conserve water, salts, and electrolytes. At least one kidney must function properly for life to be maintained. Each kidney contains 1.2 million filtering units called nephrons. After filtration, blood leaving the glomerulus flows through the network of capillaries that surrounds each tubule; water and certain salts, are restored to the blood. The purified blood returns to the renal vein. Urine from the kidney pelvis passes into the ureters. Muscles in the walls of the ureters send the urine in small spurts into the bladder, for temporary storage of urine. A full bladder stimulates sensory nerves in the bladder wall that relax the sphincter and allow release of the urine. The released urine enters the urethra, a tube lined with mucus membrane that conveys the urine to the outside. The male urethra terminates at the tip of the penis. The female urethra is less than 5 cm long and opens just in front of the entrance to the vagina. The urinary system disorders are: Congenital malformation, injury, infection, presence of kidney stones, or calculi, other types of obstruction, and tumors, cystitis, nephritis, nephrosis.},

abstract = {A vaccine against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is needed to prevent diarrheal illness among children in developing countries and at-risk travelers. Two live attenuated ETEC strains, PTL002 and PTL003, which express the ETEC colonization factor CFA/II, were evaluated for safety and immunogenicity. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 19 subjects ingested one dose, and 21 subjects ingested two doses (days 0 and 10) of PTL-002 or PTL-003 at 2 x 10(9) CFU/dose. Anti-CFA/II mucosal immune responses were determined from the number of antibody-secreting cells (ASC) in blood measured by enzyme-linked immunospot assay, the antibody in lymphocyte supernatants (ALS) measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and fecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels determined by ELISA. Time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) ELISA was more sensitive than standard colorimetric ELISA for measuring serum antibody responses to CFA/II and its components, CS1 and CS3. Both constructs were well tolerated. Mild diarrhea occurred after 2 of 31 doses (6{\%}) of PTL-003. PTL-003 produced more sustained intestinal colonization than PTL-002 and better IgA response rates: 90{\%} versus 55{\%} (P = 0.01) for anti-CFA/II IgA-ASCs, 55{\%} versus 30{\%} (P = 0.11) for serum anti-CS1 IgA by TRF, and 65{\%} versus 25{\%} (P = 0.03) for serum anti-CS3 IgA by TRF. Serum IgG response rates to CS1 or CS3 were 55{\%} in PTL-003 recipients and 15{\%} in PTL-002 recipients (P = 0.02). Two doses of either strain were not significantly more immunogenic than one. Based on its superior immunogenicity, which was comparable to that of a virulent ETEC strain and other ETEC vaccine candidates, PTL-003 will be developed further as a component of a live, oral attenuated ETEC vaccine.},

NGB is a recently discovered heme protein and its function still is a matter of debate. So far, the protein has been studied in its purified form, and in vivo measurements on the single cell level could give more information. To study the feasibility of the combined techniques, the possibilities of the setup are investigated by taking spectra from single cells and clusters of cells. We find that the microresonance Raman technique enables studies of the wt NGB protein in a living cell under fluctuating aerobic and anaerobic conditions. E. coli cells overexpressing wt NGB are stable, and the reversible oxygenation-deoxygenation can be studied over a long period of time. Further, the experiment indicates the presence of an enzymatic system in the bacteria reducing the ferric form NGB. The study of E. coli cells overexpressing E7Leu NGB, on the other hand, gives insight into limiting factors of the setup, such as cell lysis, photoinduced chemistry, and protein concentrations.},

abstract = {Abstract This review summarizes current knowledge on the structure, function, assembly and biomedical applications of the superfamily of adhesive fimbrial organelles exposed on the surface of Gram-negative pathogens with the classical chaperone/usher machinery. High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) structure studies of the minifibers assembling with the FGL (having a long F1-G1 loop) and FGS (having a short F1-G1 loop) chaperones show that they exploit the same principle of donor-strand complementation for polymerization of subunits. The 3D structure of adhesive subunits bound to host-cell receptors and the final architecture of adhesive fimbrial organelles reveal two functional families of the organelles, respectively, possessing polyadhesive and monoadhesive binding. The FGL and FGS chaperone-assembled polyadhesins are encoded exclusively by the gene clusters of the gamma3- and kappa-monophyletic groups, respectively, while gene clusters belonging to the gamma1-, gamma2-, gamma4-, and pi-fimbrial clades exclusively encode FGS chaperone-assembled monoadhesins. Novel approaches are suggested for a rational design of antimicrobials inhibiting the organelle assembly or inhibiting their binding to host-cell receptors. Vaccines are currently under development based on the recombinant subunits of adhesins.},

Although the construction of an optical tweezers system only requires basic skills in optics, the realization of an optical tweezers set LIP is not always as easy as it seems. A number of designs for moveable traps have been presented in the literature. It is not clear to the readers, however, how the movability of the trap affects its quality. We have therefore scrutinized and compared the most commonly used techniques for steering of an optical trap in terms of the aberrations they introduce. The study shows that a moveable trap based on the movement of a lens introduces significantly more aberration than the systems based on fiber optics or the tilting of a mirror.},

HL-60 cell rolling adhesion to surface-immobilized P-selectin was used to model the WBC-EC adhesion process. Changes in flow shear stress, cell deformability, or substrate ligand strength resulted in significant changes in the characteristic adhesion binding time, cell-surface contact and cell rolling velocity. A 2-D model indicated that cell-substrate contact area under a high wall shear stress (20 dyn/cm2) could be nearly twice of that under a low stress (0.5 dyn/cm2) due to shear flow-induced cell deformation. An increase in contact area resulted in more energy dissipation to both adhesion bonds and viscous cytoplasm, whereas the fluid energy that inputs to a cell decreased due to a flattened cell shape. The model also predicted a plateau of WBC rolling velocity as flow shear stresses further increased. Both experimental and computational studies have described how WBC deformation influences the WBC-EC adhesion process in shear flow.},

Fluorescence lifetime imaging and tomographic phase microscopy, quantitative deconvolution microscopy, and X-ray microanalysis, are used to measure haemoglobin concentration, cell volume, and ion contents. Atomic force microscopy is briefly reviewed in the context of these optical methodologies. We also describe how optical tweezers and optical stretchers can be usefully applied to empower basic malaria research to yield diagnostic information on cell compliance changes upon malaria infection. The combined application of these techniques sheds new light on the detailed mechanisms of malaria infection providing potential for new diagnostic or therapeutic approaches.},

abstract = {Uropathogenic strains of Escherichia coli are characterized by the expression of distinctive bacterial properties, products, or structures referred to as virulence factors because they help the organism overcome host defenses and colonize or invade the urinary tract. Virulence factors of recognized importance in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection (UTI) include adhesins (P fimbriae, certain other mannose-resistant adhesins, and type 1 fimbriae), the aerobactin system, hemolysin, K capsule, and resistance to serum killing. This review summarizes the virtual explosion of information regarding the epidemiology, biochemistry, mechanisms of action, and genetic basis of these urovirulence factors that has occurred in the past decade and identifies areas in need of further study. Virulence factor expression is more common among certain genetically related groups of E. coli which constitute virulent clones within the larger E. coli population. In general, the more virulence factors a strain expresses, the more severe an infection it is able to cause. Certain virulence factors specifically favor the development of pyelonephritis, others favor cystitis, and others favor asymptomatic bacteriuria. The currently defined virulence factors clearly contribute to the virulence of wild-type strains but are usually insufficient in themselves to transform an avirulent organism into a pathogen, demonstrating that other as-yet-undefined virulence properties await discovery. Virulence factor testing is a useful epidemiological and research tool but as yet has no defined clinical role. Immunological and biochemical anti-virulence factor interventions are effective in animal models of UTI and hold promise for the prevention of UTI in humans.},

abstract = {Periplasmic chaperones direct the assembly of adhesive, multi-subunit pilus fibers that play critical roles in bacterial pathogenesis. Pilus assembly occurs via a donor strand exchange mechanism in which the N-terminal extension of one subunit replaces the chaperone G(1) strand that transiently occupies a groove in the neighboring subunit. Here, we show that the chaperone primes the subunit for assembly by holding the groove in an open, activated conformation. During donor strand exchange, the subunit undergoes a topological transition that triggers the closure of the groove and seals the N-terminal extension in place. It is this topological transition, made possible only by the priming action of the chaperone that drives subunit assembly into the fiber.},

abstract = {Sorting nexin 9 (SNX9) belongs to a family of proteins, the sorting nexins, that are characterized by the presence of a subclass of the phosphoinositide-binding phox domain. SNX9 has in its amino terminus a Src homology 3 domain and a region with predicted low complexity followed by a carboxyl-terminal part containing the phox domain. We previously found that SNX9 is one of the major proteins in hematopoietic cells that binds to the alpha and beta2-appendages of adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2), a protein with a critical role in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane. In the present study we show that clathrin and dynamin-2, two other essential molecules in the endocytic process, also interact with SNX9. We found that both AP-2 and clathrin bind to the low complexity region in SNX9 in a cooperative manner, whereas dynamin-2 binds to the Src homology 3 domain. In the cytosol, SNX9 is present in a 14.5 S complex containing dynamin-2 and an unidentified 41-kDa protein. In HeLa cells, SNX9 co-localized with both AP-2 and dynamin-2 at the plasma membrane or on vesicular structures derived from it but not with the early endosomal marker EEA1 or with AP-1. The results suggest that SNX9 may be recruited together with dynamin-2 and become co-assembled with AP-2 and clathrin at the plasma membrane. Overexpression in both K562 and HeLa cells of truncated forms of SNX9 interfered with the uptake of transferrin, consistent with a role of SNX9 in endocytosis.},

abstract = {Measurements made on large ensembles of molecules are routinely interpreted using thermodynamics, but the normal rules of thermodynamics may not apply to measurements made on single molecules. Using a polymer stretching experiment as an example, it is shown that in the limit of a single, short molecule the outcome of experimental measurements may depend on which variables are held fixed and which are allowed to fluctuate. Thus an experiment in which the end-to-end distance of the polymer molecule is fixed and the tension fluctuates yields a different result than an experiment where the force is fixed and the end-to-end distance fluctuates. It is further shown that this difference is due to asymmetry in the distribution of end-to-end distances for a single molecule, and that the difference vanishes in the appropriate thermodynamic limit; that is, as the polymer molecule becomes long compared to its persistence length. Despite these differences, much of the thermodynamic formalism still applies on the single-molecule level if the thermodynamic free energies are replaced with appropriate potentials of mean force. The primary remaining differences are consequences of the fact that unlike the free energies, the potentials of mean force are not in general homogeneous functions of their variables. The basic thermodynamic concepts of an intensive or extensive quantity, and the thermodynamic relationships that follow from them, are therefore less useful for interpreting single-molecule experiments.},

@article{Evans1999a,
abstract = {Weak non-covalent interactions between large molecules govern interfacial structure and adhesion in biology. Because of thermal activation, these bonds have modest lifetimes and bond lifetimes are progressively shortened under application of external force. Theory predicts that bond survival time depends on how fast the force is applied and the expected survival time specifies the most likely breakage force (strength) at a given loading rate (force/time). Plotted as a function of log(e) (loading rate), the dynamic spectrum of bond strength provides an image of the prominent barriers traversed in the energy landscape along the unbinding pathway, which establishes a direct link between measurements of bond force and molecular-scale chemistry. Experimentally, the challenge is to measure bond strength over several orders of magnitude in loading rate. With a recently designed probe technique, we have measured strengths of single receptor-ligand bonds and receptor-membrane anchoring over an enormous range of loading rates from 10-1 pN/s to 105 pN/s, which reveals an inner view of the complexity of these interactions.

abstract = {Force spectroscopies have emerged as a powerful and unprecedented tool to study and manipulate biomolecules directly at a molecular level. Usually, protein and DNA behavior under force is described within the framework of the worm-like chain (WLC) model for polymer elasticity. Although it has been surprisingly successful for the interpretation of experimental data, especially at high forces, the WLC model lacks structural and dynamical molecular details associated with protein relaxation under force that are key to the understanding of how force affects protein flexibility and reactivity. We use molecular dynamics simulations of ubiquitin to provide a deeper understanding of protein relaxation under force. We find that the WLC model successfully describes the simulations of ubiquitin, especially at higher forces, and we show how protein flexibility and persistence length, probed in the force regime of the experiments, are related to how specific classes of backbone dihedral angles respond to applied force. Although the WLC model is an average, backbone model, we show how the protein side chains affect the persistence length. Finally, we find that the diffusion coefficient of the protein's end-to-end distance is on the order of 10(8) nm(2)/s, is position and side-chain dependent, but is independent of the length and independent of the applied force, in contrast with other descriptions.},

abstract = {The FimH protein is the adhesive subunit of Escherichia coli type 1 fimbriae. It mediates shear-dependent bacterial binding to monomannose (1M)-coated surfaces manifested by the existence of a shear threshold for binding, below which bacteria do not adhere. The 1M-specific shear-dependent binding of FimH is consistent with so-called catch bond interactions, whose lifetime is increased by tensile force. We show here that the oligosaccharide-specific interaction of FimH with another of its ligands, trimannose (3M), lacks a shear threshold for binding, since the number of bacteria binding under static conditions is higher than under any flow. However, similar to 1M, the binding strength of surface-interacting bacteria is enhanced by shear. Bacteria transition from rolling into firm stationary surface adhesion as the shear increases. The shear-enhanced bacterial binding on 3M is mediated by catch bond properties of the 1M-binding subsite within the extended oligosaccharide-binding pocket of FimH, since structural mutations in the putative force-responsive region and in the binding site affect 1M- and 3M-specific binding in an identical manner. A shear-dependent conversion of the adhesion mode is also exhibited by P-fimbriated E. coli adhering to digalactose surfaces.},

Uropathogenic P-pili are sufficiently mechanically resilient to resist the cleansing action of urine flow that removes most other bacteria. P-pili are 68 A in diameter and approximately 1 micron long, and are composed of approximately 1,000 copies of the principal structural protein, PapA. They are attached to the outer membrane by a minor structural protein, PapH and are terminated by an approximately 20 A diameter fibrillus composed of PapK, PapE and PapF, which presents the host-binding adhesin PapG. The amino-acid sequences of PapA, PapE, and PapF are similar, with highly conserved C-termini being responsible for binding to PapD, the periplasmic chaperone. Our three-dimensional reconstruction indicates that pili are formed by the tight winding of a much thinner structure. A structural transition allows the pilus to unravel without depolymerizing, producing a thin, extended structure five times the length of the original pilus.},

We did a systematic review of articles published between 1990 and 2011 reporting at least one of 13 pathogens in children <5 years of age hospitalized with diarrhea. We included 2011 rotavirus data from the Rotavirus Surveillance Network coordinated by WHO. We excluded studies conducted during diarrhea outbreaks that did not discriminate between inpatient and outpatient cases, reporting nosocomial infections, those conducted in special populations, not done with adequate methods, and rotavirus studies in countries where the rotavirus vaccine was used. Age-adjusted median proportions for each pathogen were calculated and applied to 712 000 deaths due to diarrhea in children under 5 years for 2011, assuming that those observed among children hospitalized for diarrhea represent those causing child diarrhea deaths. 163 articles and WHO studies done in 31 countries were selected representing 286 inpatient studies. Studies seeking only one pathogen found higher proportions for some pathogens than studies seeking multiple pathogens (e.g. 39{\%} rotavirus in 180 single-pathogen studies vs. 20{\%} in 24 studies with 5-13 pathogens, p<0.0001). The percentage of episodes for which no pathogen could be identified was estimated to be 34{\%}; the total of all age-adjusted percentages for pathogens and no-pathogen cases was 138{\%}. Adjusting all proportions, including unknowns, to add to 100{\%}, we estimated that rotavirus caused 197 000 [Uncertainty range (UR) 110 000-295 000], enteropathogenic E. coli 79 000 (UR 31 000-146 000), calicivirus 71 000 (UR 39 000-113 000), and enterotoxigenic E. coli 42 000 (UR 20 000-76 000) deaths. Rotavirus, calicivirus, enteropathogenic and enterotoxigenic E. coli cause more than half of all diarrheal deaths in children <5 years in the world.},

The algorithm makes use of the contiguous (connected) set of edge segments produced by our parameter-free edge segment detector, the Edge Drawing Parameter Free (EDPF) algorithm; hence the name EDCircles. The proposed algorithm first computes the edge segments in a given image using EDPF, which are then converted into line segments. The detected line segments are converted into circular arcs, which are joined together using two heuristic algorithms to detect candidate circles and near-circular ellipses. The candidates are finally validated by an a contrario validation step due to the Helmholtz principle, which eliminates false detections leaving only valid circles and near-circular ellipses. We show through experimentation that EDCircles works real-time (10-20 ms for 640??480 images), has high detection rates, produces accurate results, and is very suitable for the next generation real-time vision applications including automatic inspection of manufactured products, eye pupil detection, circular traffic sign detection, etc. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {CfaE is the minor, tip-localized adhesive subunit of colonization factor antigen I fimbriae (CFA/I) of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and is thought to be essential for the attachment of enterotoxigenic E. coli to the human small intestine early in diarrhea pathogenesis. The crystal structure of an in cis donor strand complemented CfaE was determined, providing the first atomic view of a fimbrial subunit assembled by the alternate chaperone pathway. The in cis donor strand complemented variant of CfaE structure consists of an N-terminal adhesin domain and a C-terminal pilin domain of similar size, each featuring a variable immunoglobulin-like fold. Extensive interactions exist between the two domains and appear to rigidify the molecule. The upper surface of the adhesin domain distal to the pilin domain reveals a depression consisting of conserved residues including Arg(181), previously shown to be necessary for erythrocyte adhesion. Mutational analysis revealed a cluster of conserved, positively charged residues that are required for CFA/I-mediated hemagglutination, implicating this as the receptor-binding pocket. Mutations in a few subclass-specific residues that surround the cluster displayed differential effects on the two red cell species used in hemagglutination, suggesting that these residues play a role in host or cell specificity. The C-terminal donor strand derived from the major subunit CfaB is folded as a beta-strand and fits into a hydrophobic groove in the pilin domain to complete the immunoglobulin fold. The location of this well ordered donor strand suggests the positioning and orientation of the subjacent major fimbrial subunit CfaB in the native assembly of CFA/I fimbriae.},

abstract = {We quantitatively examined the possible damage to the growth and cell division ability of Escherichia coli caused by 1064-nm optical trapping. Using the synchronous behavior of two sister E. coli cells, the growth and interdivision times between those two cells, one of which was trapped by optical tweezers, the other was not irradiated, were compared using an on-chip single cell cultivation system. Cell growth stopped during the optical trapping period, even with the smallest irradiated power on the trapped cells. Moreover, the damage to the cell's growth and interdivision period was proportional to the total irradiated energy (work) on the cell, i.e., irradiation time multiplied by irradiation power. The division ability was more easily affected by a smaller energy, 0.36 J, which was 30{\%} smaller than the energy that adversely affected growth, 0.54 J. The results indicate that the damage caused by optical trapping can be estimated from the total energy applied to cells, and furthermore, that the use of optical trapping for manipulating cells might cause damage to cell division and growth mechanisms, even at wavelengths under 1064 nm, if the total irradiation energy is excessive. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Living cells in culture are optically probed by measuring the phase shift they produce on the transmitted wave front. The high temporal stability of the phase signal, equivalent to ?/1800, and the low acquisition time ({\~{}}20�s) enable to monitor cellular dynamics processes. An experimental procedure allowing to calculate both the integral refractive index and the cellular thickness (morphometry) from the measured phase shift is presented. Specifically, the method has been applied to study the dynamics of neurons in culture during a hypotonic stress. Such stress produces a paradoxical decrease of the phase which can be entirely resolved by applying the methodological approach described in this article; indeed the method allows to determine independently the thickness and the integral refractive index of cells.},

abstract = {Cell mechanical properties play an important role in determining many cellular activities. Passive microrheology techniques, such as Multiple-Particle-Tracking (MPT) give an insight into the structural rearrangements and viscoelastic response of a wide range of materials, in particular soft materials and complex fluids like cell cytoplasm in living cells. The technique finds an important field of application in large cells such as oocytes where, during their growth, several organelles and molecules are displaced in specific territories of the cell instrumental for later embryonic development. To measure cell mechanics, cells are usually deformed by many techniques that are slow and often invasive. To overcome these limits, the MPT technique is applied. Probe particles are embedded in the viscoelastic sample and their properties are extracted from the thermal fluctuation spectra measured using digital video-microscopy. The Brownian motion of a probe particle immersed in a network is directly related to the network's mechanical properties. Particles exhibit larger motions when their local environments are less rigid or less viscous. The mean-square-displacement (MSD) of the particle's trajectory is used to quantify its amplitude of motions over different time scales.},

abstract = {E. coil expressing the papA-I genes produce pili that mediate specific adhesion to mammalian cells. We show that the major pilus subunit gene, papA, is part of a polycistronic transcriptional unit subject to specific posttranscriptional processing. A primary transcript also encoding the papB regulatory gene product is endon cleolytically cleaved, resulting in the rapid decay of the papB-encoding 5′ half of the mRNA, whereas the papA-encoding 3′ half remains as a quite stable transcript. Processing and differential mRNA stability thereby result in accumulation of mRNAs encoding only the major pilus subunit. A sequence immediately downstream of the papA coding region may serve as a stability determinant for the papA transcript and concomitantly attenuate read-through transcription into the minor pilus subunit gene papH. This suggests that differential expression of genes within an operon may include endo- and exonucleolytic processing of the mRNA.},

abstract = {Titin is a giant protein that determines the elasticity of striated muscle and is thought to play important roles in numerous regulatory processes. Previous studies have shown that titin's PEVK domain interacts with F-actin, thereby creating viscous forces of unknown magnitude that may modulate muscle contraction. Here we measured, with optical tweezers, the forces necessary to dissociate F-actin from individual molecules of recombinant PEVK fragments rich either in polyE or PPAK motifs. Rupture forces at a stretch rate of 250 nm/s displayed a wide, nonnormal distribution with a peak at approximately 8 pN in the case of both fragments. Dynamic force spectroscopy experiments revealed low spontaneous off-rates that were increased even by low forces. The loading-rate dependence of rupture force was biphasic for polyE in contrast with the monophasic response observed for PPAK. Analysis of the molecular lengths at which rupture occurred indicated that there are numerous actin-binding regions along the PEVK fragments' contour, suggesting that the PEVK domain is a promiscuous actin-binding partner. The complexity of PEVK-actin interaction points to an adaptable viscoelastic mechanism that safeguards sarcomeric structural integrity in the relaxed state and modulates thixotropic behavior during contraction.},

abstract = {Colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) is the archetype of eight genetically related fimbriae of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) designated class 5 fimbriae. Assembled by the alternate chaperone pathway, these organelles comprise a rigid stalk of polymerized major subunits and an apparently tip-localized minor adhesive subunit. We examined the evolutionary relationships of class 5-specific structural proteins and correlated these with functional properties. We sequenced the gene clusters encoding coli surface antigen 4 (CS4), CS14, CS17, CS19, and putative colonization factor antigen O71 (PCFO71) and analyzed the deduced proteins and the published homologs of CFA/I, CS1, and CS2. Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis of the proteins encoded by each operon define three subclasses, 5a (CFA/I, CS4, and CS14), 5b (CS1, CS17, CS19, and PCFO71), and 5c (CS2). These share distant evolutionary relatedness to fimbrial systems of three other genera. Subclass divisions generally correlate with distinguishing in vitro adherence phenotypes of strains bearing the ETEC fimbriae. Phylogenetic comparisons of the individual structural proteins demonstrated greater intrasubclass conservation among the minor subunits than the major subunits. To correlate this with functional attributes, we made antibodies against CFA/I and CS17 whole fimbriae and maltose-binding protein fusions with the amino-terminal half of the corresponding minor subunits. Anti-minor subunit Fab preparations showed hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) of ETEC expressing homologous and intrasubclass heterologous colonization factors while anti-fimbrial Fab fractions showed HAI activity limited to colonization factor-homologous ETEC. These results were corroborated with similar results from the Caco-2 cell adherence assay. Our findings suggest that the minor subunits of class 5 fimbriae may be superior to whole fimbriae in inducing antiadhesive immunity.},

abstract = {Type 1 pili are the archetypal representative of a widespread class of adhesive multisubunit fibres in Gram-negative bacteria. During pilus assembly, subunits dock as chaperone-bound complexes to an usher, which catalyses their polymerization and mediates pilus translocation across the outer membrane. Here we report the crystal structure of the full-length FimD usher bound to the FimC-FimH chaperone-adhesin complex and that of the unbound form of the FimD translocation domain. The FimD-FimC-FimH structure shows FimH inserted inside the FimD 24-stranded $\beta$-barrel translocation channel. FimC-FimH is held in place through interactions with the two carboxy-terminal periplasmic domains of FimD, a binding mode confirmed in solution by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. To accommodate FimH, the usher plug domain is displaced from the barrel lumen to the periplasm, concomitant with a marked conformational change in the $\beta$-barrel. The amino-terminal domain of FimD is observed in an ideal position to catalyse incorporation of a newly recruited chaperone-subunit complex. The FimD-FimC-FimH structure provides unique insights into the pilus subunit incorporation cycle, and captures the first view of a protein transporter in the act of secreting its cognate substrate.},

The protocol was developed for single-molecule investigation of the dynamics of supercoiled DNA, and it allows the investigation of both the dynamics of the molecule itself and of its interactions with a regulatory protein. Two bis-PNA clamps designed to bind with extremely high affinity to predetermined homopurine sequence sites in supercoiled DNA are prepared: one conjugated with digoxigenin for attachment to an anti-digoxigenin-coated glass cover slide, and one conjugated with biotin for attachment to a submicron-sized streptavidin-coated polystyrene bead. Plasmids are constructed, purified and incubated with the PNA handles. The dynamics of the construct is analyzed by tracking the tethered bead using video microscopy: less supercoiling results in more movement, and more supercoiling results in less movement. In contrast to other single-molecule methodologies, the current methodology allows for studying DNA in its naturally supercoiled state with constant linking number and constant writhe. The protocol has potential for use in studying the influence of supercoils on the dynamics of DNA and its associated proteins, e.g., topoisomerase. The procedure takes ∼4 weeks.},

abstract = {Using a parallel-plate flow chamber, the hydrodynamic shear forces to prevent bacterial adhesion (F(prev)) and to detach adhering bacteria (F(det)) were evaluated for hydrophilic glass, hydrophobic, dimethyldichlorosilane (DDS)-coated glass and six different bacterial strains, in order to test the following three hypotheses. 1. A strong hydrodynamic shear force to prevent adhesion relates to a strong hydrodynamic shear force to detach an adhering organism. 2. A weak hydrodynamic shear force to detach adhering bacteria implies that more bacteria will be stimulated to detach by passing an air-liquid interface (an air bubble) through the flow chamber. 3. DLVO (Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey, Overbeek) interactions determine the characteristic hydrodynamic shear forces to prevent adhesion and to detach adhering micro-organisms as well as the detachment induced by a passing air-liquid interface. F(prev) varied from 0.03 to 0.70 pN, while F(det) varied from 0.31 to over 19.64 pN, suggesting that after initial contact, strengthening of the bond occurs. Generally, it was more difficult to detach bacteria from DDS-coated glass than from hydrophilic glass, which was confirmed by air bubble detachment studies. Calculated attractive forces based on the DLVO theory (F(DLVO)) towards the secondary interaction minimum were higher on glass than on DDS-coated glass. In general, all three hypotheses had to be rejected, showing that it is important to distinguish between forces acting parallel (hydrodynamic shear) and perpendicular (DLVO, air-liquid interface passages) to the substratum surface.},

abstract = {Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most common form of prostate disease in middle-aged and elderly men, and leads to severe impairment later in life. Despite its significant impact on public health, the underlying cause of BPH is yet to be determined. This hypothesis proposes a new causal factor for BPH. Applying concepts of dynamics of fluids to the process of urination it could be stated that a turbulent urinary flow through the passage of the urethra. The turbulent urinary flow in the urethra applies pressure and stretch forces to the surrounding tissue. This stimulus repeated over time and coupled with age-related changes of the urethral tissue could contribute to the development of BPH. In support of this hypothesis, several mechanotransduction studies have shown that vibration and pressure forces applied to different cell tissues can provoke cellular and molecular changes. Another supportive data is the presence of the hyperplasic reaction surrounding the urethra specifically located in the transition zone, the only zone where BPH develops. It is crucial to identify causal factors to understanding the disease and to determine effective primary prevention strategies. Future studies of the dynamics of fluids in the urethra are warranted. The finding of significant forces transmitted to the periurethral tissue from a turbulent urinary flow could give us the clue to the underlying cause of BPH. If this hypothesis proves to be valid there are several primary prevention measures that could be implemented to impede the development of BPH. Educational intervention measures in younger populations to avoid frequent urinary retention and active urination (process of forcing the urine through the urethra at a high velocity) could be considered. Studies of the impact of turbulence in the standing vs. sitting position during urination in men should also be considered.},

abstract = {Bacterial surface colonizers are subject to a variety of physical stresses. During the colonization of human epithelia such as on the skin or the intestinal mucosa, bacteria mainly have to withstand the mechanical stress of being removed by fluid flow, scraping, or epithelial turnover. To that end, they express a series of molecules to establish firm attachment to the epithelial surface, such as fibrillar protrusions (pili) and surface-anchored proteins that bind to human matrix proteins. In addition, some bacteria - in particular gut and urinary tract pathogens - use internalization by epithelial cells and other methods such as directed inhibition of epithelial turnover to ascertain continued association with the epithelial layer. Furthermore, many bacteria produce multi-layered agglomerations called biofilms with a sticky extracellular matrix, providing additional protection from removal. This review will give an overview over the mechanisms human bacterial colonizers have to withstand physical stresses with a focus on bacterial adhesion. This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {P-pili of uropathogenic Escherichia coli mediate the attachment to epithelial cells in the human urinary tract and kidney and therefore play an important role in infection. A better understanding of this mechanism could help to prevent bacteria from spreading but also provides interesting insights into molecular mechanics for future nanotech applications. The helical rod design of P-pili provides an efficient design to withstand hydrodynamic shear forces. The adhesive PapG unit at the distal end of the P-pilus forms a specific bond with the glycolipid Galabiose. This bond has a potential width Deltax = 0.7 +/- 0.15 nm and a dissociation rate K (Off) = 8.0.10(-4) +/- 5.0.10(-4) s(-1). It withstands a force of approximately 49 pN under physiological conditions. Additionally, we analyzed the behavior of unstacking and restacking of the P-pilus with dynamic force spectroscopy at velocities between 200 and 7,000 nm/s. Up to a critical extension of 66{\%} of the totally stretched P-pilus, un/re-stacking was found to be fully reversible at velocities up to 200 nm/s. If the P-pilus is stretched beyond this critical extension a characteristic hysteresis appears upon restacking. This hysteresis originates from a nucleation process comparable to a first-order phase transition in an undercooled liquid. Analysis of the measurement data suggests that 20 PapA monomers are involved in the formation of a nucleation kernel.},

abstract = {Most pathogens gain access to the host through surfaces of the body that are exposed to the surrounding environment and rife with resident microorganisms, termed microbiota. Microbiota play an integral role in modulating host health. One significant benefit of the microbiota is that they provide protection against incoming bacterial pathogens 1. Commensals make their immediate environment inhospitable to many pathogens by producing biosurfactants, by competing for sites of attachment and nutrients, and by excreting metabolites with antimicrobial effects 1. Furthermore, the presence of commensals promotes maturation of secondary lymphoid organs in the intestine, which are the first line of defense in the intestinal mucosa 2. Therefore, when a pathogen infiltrates the host, it is not entering a sterile environment, but one that has been shaped by a dynamic commensal community. Although many interactions between bacterial pathogens and the microbiota have been characterized 1, little is known about the interplay between viral pathogens and the natural flora of the host. Are viral pathogens blind to the commensal microbes surrounding them? Judging from recent publications, this appears not to be the case. There is strong evidence that the microbiota can either protect the host from virally induced disease or promote viral propagation/transmission, through direct or indirect mechanisms.},

We demonstrate that stable trapping can occur with optical tweezers when they are used with small metallic Rayleigh particles. In this size regime, the scattering pictures for metals and dielectrics are similar, and the larger polarizability of metals implies that trapping forces are greater. The latter fact makes the use of metal particles attractive for certain biological applications. Comparison of trapping forces for latex and gold spheres demonstrates that the gradient force is the major determinant of trapping strength and that competing effects, such as scattering or radiometric forces, are relatively minor.},

abstract = {Although ubiquitous, the processes by which bacteria colonize surfaces remain poorly understood. Here we report results for the influence of the wall shear stress on the early-stage adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 on glass and polydimethylsiloxane surfaces. We use image analysis to measure the residence time of each adhering bacterium under flow. Our main finding is that, on either surface, the characteristic residence time of bacteria increases approximately linearly as the shear stress increases (0-3.5 Pa). To investigate this phenomenon, we used mutant strains defective in surface organelles (type I pili, type IV pili, or the flagellum) or extracellular matrix production. Our results show that, although these bacterial surface features influence the frequency of adhesion events and the early-stage detachment probability, none of them is responsible for the trend in the shear-enhanced adhesion time. These observations bring what we believe are new insights into the mechanism of bacterial attachment in shear flows, and suggest a role for other intrinsic features of the cell surface, or a dynamic cell response to shear stress.},

abstract = {Juxtaposition kinetics between specific sites in supercoiled DNA is investigated at close to physiological ionic conditions by Brownian dynamics simulations. At such conditions, supercoiled DNA is interwound, and the probability of spatial site juxtaposition is much higher than in relaxed DNA. We find, however, that supercoiling does not correspondingly increase the rate of juxtaposition at these physiological conditions. An explanation to this unexpected finding emerges on analysis of the juxtaposition dynamics. We note that although a particular site i(1) in supercoiled DNA is often in close proximity (juxtaposed) to another site i(2), the change of i(2) occurs very slowly and depends largely on internal slithering of opposite segments of the DNA superhelix. Such slithering results in long correlations between successive values of i(2); these correlations increase the average time of juxtaposition between two DNA sites. Random collisions between sites located on different superhelix branches-although increasing in importance with DNA size-contribute less substantially to site juxtaposition at high salt than slithering for DNA up to 6 kb in length.},

This was done first at low field strengths, then at field strengths generating speeds high enough to disrupt motor function, and finally at low field strengths. Comparison of the initial and final speed versus applied-torque plots yielded relative motor torque. For backward rotation, motor torque rose steeply at speeds close to zero, peaking, on average, at about 2.2 times the stall torque. For forward rotation, motor torque remained approximately constant up to speeds of about 60{\%} of the zero-torque speed. Then the torque dropped linearly with speed, crossed zero, and reached a minimum, on average, at about -1.7 times the stall torque. The zero-torque speed increased with temperature (about 90 Hz at 11 degrees C, 140 Hz at 16 degrees C, and 290 Hz at 23 degrees C), while other parameters remained approximately constant. Sometimes the motor slipped at either extreme (delivered constant torque over a range of speeds), but eventually it broke. Similar results were obtained whether motors broke catastrophically (suddenly and completely) or progressively or were de-energized by brief treatment with an uncoupler. These results are consistent with a tightly coupled ratchet mechanism, provided that elastic deformation of force-generating elements is limited by a stop and that mechanical components yield at high applied torques.},

abstract = {The plasmid pCS001, isolated from an enterotoxigenic strain of Escherichia coli, mediates expression of the CS1 or CS2 and CS3 fimbrial adhesins in appropriate E. coli hosts. To characterize this further, HindIII-generated DNA fragments of this plasmid were cloned into the vector plasmid pBR322. A chimaera, called pCS200, which mediated expression of the CS1 or CS2 fimbrial antigen but not of CS3 fimbrial antigen in appropriate host strains, was obtained. The DNA inserted into the vector sequences of plasmid pCS200 comprised HindIII fragments of 4.7 kbp and 0.8 kbp. Plasmid pCS200-carrying wild-type E. coli hosts of serotype O6:K15:H16 that expressed the CS1 or CS2 antigen also caused mannose-resistant agglutination of bovine red blood cells, suggesting that functional fimbriae were present on the bacterial surface. As previously observed with strain K12 recipients of CS-fimbriae-associated plasmids mobilized from wild-type enterotoxigenic E. coli, K12 recipients of the chimaeric plasmid pCS200 did not express the CS1 or CS2 fimbrial antigen. An oligonucleotide probe, synthesized on the basis of the published N-terminal amino acid sequence of the CS2 fimbrial subunit, hybridized to plasmid pCS200, indicating that the gene for the structural subunit of this fimbria resided on the plasmid.},

abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria often initiate their colonization by use of extended attachment organelles, so called pili. When exposed to force, the rod of helix-like pili has been found to be highly extendable, mainly attributed to uncoiling and recoiling of its quaternary structure. This provides the bacteria with the ability to redistribute an external force among a multitude of pili, which enables them to withstand strong rinsing flows, which, in turn, facilitates adherence and colonization processes critical to virulence. Thus, pili fibers are possible targets for novel antibacterial agents. By use of a substance that compromises compliance of the pili, the ability of bacteria to redistribute external forces can be impaired, so they will no longer be able to resist strong urine flow and thus be removed from the host. It is possible such a substance can serve as an alternative to existing antibiotics in the future or be a part of a multi-drug. In this work we investigated whether it is possible to achieve this by targeting the recoiling process. The test substance was purified PapD. The effect of PapD on the compliance of P pili was assessed at the single organelle level by use of force-measuring optical tweezers. We showed that the recoiling process, and thus the biomechanical compliance, in particular the recoiling process, can be impaired by the presence of PapD. This leads to a new concept in the search for novel drug candidates combating uropathogenic bacterial infections--"coilicides", targeting the subunits of which the pilus rod is composed.},

As an example, we sorted the live and dead yeast cells into the collection chamber and validated this with a standard staining technique. We also demonstrated that bacteria existing in spoiled foods could be discriminated from a variety of food particles based on their characteristic Raman spectra and then isolated with laser manipulation.

abstract = {We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to explore the antigen binding forces of individual Fv fragments of antilysozyme antibodies (Fv). To detect single molecular recognition events, genetically engineered histidine-tagged Fv fragments were coupled onto AFM tips modified with mixed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of nitrilotriacetic acid- and tri(ethylene glycol)-terminated alkanethiols while lysozyme (Lyso) was covalently immobilized onto mixed SAMs of carboxyl- and hydroxyl-terminated alkanethiols. The quality of the functionalization procedure was validated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (surface chemical composition), AFM imaging (surface morphology in aqueous solution), and surface plasmon resonance (SPR, specific binding in aqueous solution). AFM force-distance curves recorded at a loading rate of 5000 pN/s between Fv- and Lyso-modified surfaces yielded a distribution of unbinding forces composed of integer multiples of an elementary force quantum of approximately 50 pN that we attribute to the rupture of a single antibody-antigen pair. Injection of a solution containing free Lyso caused a dramatic reduction of adhesion probability, indicating that the measured 50 pN unbinding forces are due to the specific antibody-antigen interaction. To investigate the dynamics of the interaction, force-distance curves were recorded at various loading rates. Plots of unbinding force vs log(loading rate) revealed two distinct linear regimes with ascending slopes, indicating multiple barriers were present in the energy landscape. The kinetic off-rate constant of dissociation (k(off) approximately = 1 x 10(-3) s(-1)) obtained by extrapolating the data of the low-strength regime to zero force was in the range of the k(off) estimated by SPR.},

Using optical tweezers, we characterized the frictional drag force of individual kinesin-8 motor proteins interacting with their microtubule tracks. At low speeds and with no energy source, the frictional drag was related to the diffusion coefficient by the Einstein relation. At higher speeds, the frictional drag force increased nonlinearly, consistent with the motor jumping 8 nanometers between adjacent tubulin dimers along the microtubule, and was asymmetric, reflecting the structural polarity of the microtubule. We argue that these frictional forces arise from breaking bonds between the motor domains and the microtubule, and they limit the speed and efficiency of kinesin.},

The observed changes in peristaltic pattern during high diuresis, obstruction and urinary reflux have influenced management of stone disease and neurogenic bladder. The demonstration that high intravesical pressure is reflected to the kidney not only when the ureteric orifice is incompetent, but also during high diuresis, established the necessity for low pressures in neobladders.

Biofilm-associated cells can be differentiated from their suspended counterparts by generation of an extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix, reduced growth rates, and the up- and down- regulation of specific genes. Attachment is a complex process regulated by diverse characteristics of the growth medium, substratum, and cell surface. An established biofilm structure comprises microbial cells and EPS, has a defined architecture, and provides an optimal environment for the exchange of genetic material between cells. Cells may also communicate via quorum sensing, which may in turn affect biofilm processes such as detachment. Biofilms have great importance for public health because of their role in certain infectious diseases and importance in a variety of device-related infections. A greater understanding of biofilm processes should lead to novel, effective control strategies for biofilm control and a resulting improvement in patient management.},

Force can also speed or slow rates of reactions; it changes the free energy of activation of the reaction.},

abstract = {We present an automated cell colony counting method that is flexible, robust and capable of providing more in-depth clonogenic analysis than existing manual and automated approaches. The full form of the Hough transform without approximation has been implemented, for the first time. Improvements in computing speed have facilitated this approach. Colony identification was achieved by pre-processing the raw images of the colonies in situ in the flask, including images of the flask edges, by erosion, dilation and Gaussian smoothing processes. Colony edges were then identified by intensity gradient field discrimination. Our technique eliminates the need for specialized hardware for image capture and enables the use of a standard desktop scanner for distortion-free image acquisition. Additional parameters evaluated included regional colony counts, average colony area, nearest neighbour distances and radial distribution. This spatial and qualitative information extends the utility of the clonogenic assay, allowing analysis of spatially-variant cytotoxic effects. To test the automated system, two flask types and three cell lines with different morphology, cell size and plating density were examined. A novel Monte Carlo method of simulating cell colony images, as well as manual counting, were used to quantify algorithm accuracy. The method was able to identify colonies with unusual morphology, to successfully resolve merged colonies and to correctly count colonies adjacent to flask edges.},

abstract = {Small ligands and their receptors are widely used non-covalent couplers in various biotech applications. One prominent example, the digoxigenin-antibody complex, was often used to immobilize samples for single molecule force measurements by optical trap or AFM. Here, we employed dynamic AFM spectroscopy to demonstrate that a single digoxigenin-antibody bond is likely to fail even under moderate loading rates. This effect potentially could lower the yield of measurements or even obscure the unbinding data of the sample by the rupture events of the coupler. Immobilization by multiple antibody-antigen bonds, therefore, is highly recommended. The analysis of our data revealed a pronounced loading rate dependence of the rupture force, which we analyzed based on the well-established Bell-Evans-model with two subsequent unbinding barriers. We could show that the first barrier has a width of Deltax(1)=1.15 nm and a spontaneous rate of k(off1)=0.015 s(-1) and the second has a width of Deltax(2)=0.35 nm and a spontaneous rate of k(off2)=4.56 s(-1). In the crossover region between the two regimes, we found a marked discrepancy between the predicted bond rupture probability density and the measured rupture force histograms, which we discuss as non-Markovian contribution to the unbinding process.},

abstract = {Uropathogenic Escherichia coli express pili that mediate binding to host tissue cells. We demonstrate with in situ force measuring optical tweezers that the ability of P and type 1 pili to elongate by unfolding under exposure to stress is a shared property with some differences. The unfolding force of the quaternary structures under equilibrium conditions is similar, 28 +/- 2 and 30 +/- 2 pN for P pili and type 1 pili, respectively. However, type 1 pili are found to be more rigid than P pili through their stronger layer-to-layer bonds. It was found that type 1 pili enter a dynamic regime at elongation speeds of 6 nm/s, compared to 400 nm/s for P pili; i.e., it responds faster to an external force. This possibly helps type 1 to withstand the irregular urine flow in the urethra as compared to the more constant urine flow in the upper urinary tract. Also, it was found that type 1 pili refold during retraction at two different levels that possibly could be related to several possible configurations. Our findings highlight functions that are believed to be of importance for the bacterial ability to sustain a basic antimicrobial mechanism of the host and for bacterial colonization.},

abstract = {The bistable gene regulatory switch controlling the transition from lysogeny to lysis in bacteriophage lambda presents a unique challenge to quantitative modeling. Despite extensive characterization of this regulatory network, the origin of the extreme stability of the lysogenic state remains unclear. We have constructed a stochastic model for this switch. Using Forward Flux Sampling simulations, we show that this model predicts an extremely low rate of spontaneous prophage induction in a recA mutant, in agreement with experimental observations. In our model, the DNA loop formed by octamerization of CI bound to the O(L) and O(R) operator regions is crucial for stability, allowing the lysogenic state to remain stable even when a large fraction of the total CI is depleted by nonspecific binding to genomic DNA. DNA looping also ensures that the switch is robust to mutations in the order of the O(R) binding sites. Our results suggest that DNA looping can provide a mechanism to maintain a stable lysogenic state in the face of a range of challenges including noisy gene expression, nonspecific DNA binding, and operator site mutations.},

abstract = {Surface organelles (so-called pili) expressed on the bacterial membrane mediate the adhesion of Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infection. These pili possess some extraordinary elongation properties that are assumed to allow a close bacterium-to-host contact even in the presence of shear forces caused by urine flow. The elongation properties of P pili have therefore been assessed for low elongation speeds (steady-state conditions). This work reports on the behavior of P pili probed by dynamic force spectroscopy. A kinetic model for the unfolding of a helixlike chain structure is derived and verified. It is shown that the unfolding of the quaternary structure of the PapA rod takes place at a constant force that is almost independent of elongation speed for slow elongations (up to approximately 0.4 mum/s), whereas it shows a dynamic response with a logarithmic dependence for fast elongations. The results provide information about the energy landscape and reaction rates. The bond length and thermal bond opening and closure rates for the layer-to-layer bond have been assessed to approximately 0.76 nm, approximately 0.8 Hz, and approximately 8 GHz, respectively. The results also support a previously constructed sticky-chain model for elongation of the PapA rod that until now had been experimentally verified only under steady-state conditions.},

@article{Andersson2006,
abstract = {Optical tweezers have previously been used to characterize the force-vs. -elongation dependence of the PapA rod of uropathogenic E. coli P pili. It was found that the PapA rod elongates in several elongation regions. In the two first, the elongation originates from an elastic stretching and a sequential unfolding of the layer-to-layer bonds (and thereby of the helical structure). Region III is characterized by an elongation that originates from an elastic stretching and an opening of the head-to-tail bonds in the linearized PapA rod. The opening of these bonds takes place in a random order, wherefore the response in this region is affected by entropy. Since the entropic softening of a macromolecule depends on the number of units, the shape of this region can be used to assess the number of PapA units. We provide in this work a recipe for how this can be done solely from the form of region III. An advantage with this technique is that it does not require a continuous monitoring of the elongation of a single PapA rod from unstretched conditions, which often is difficult because of simultaneous multi-pili binding; it suffices to detect it in the third region at which binding often is mediated by only one pilus. Another advantage is that it does not require any prior knowledge about (or assessment of) any physical entity of the PapA rod; the number of PapA units can be assessed solely from the shape of the curve in the third elongation region.},

parameter point has to be solved for one <e1>n</e1>-tuple of points, and
the presence of a specific curve in the image is quickly revealed by the
accumulation of a small number of parameter points},

abstract = {Single-molecule manipulation instruments, such as optical traps and magnetic tweezers, frequently use video tracking to measure the position of a force-generating probe. The instruments are calibrated by comparing the measured probe motion to a model of Brownian motion in a harmonic potential well; the results of calibration are estimates of the probe drag, $\alpha$, and spring constant, $\kappa$. Here, we present both time- and frequency-domain methods to accurately and precisely extract $\alpha$ and $\kappa$ from the probe trajectory. In the frequency domain, we discuss methods to estimate the power spectral density (PSD) from data (including windowing and blocking), and we derive an analytical formula for the PSD which accounts both for aliasing and the filtering intrinsic to video tracking. In the time domain, we focus on the Allan variance (AV): we present a theoretical equation for the AV relevant to typical single-molecule setups and discuss the optimal manner for computing the AV from experimental data using octave-sampled overlapping bins. We show that, when using maximum-likelihood methods to fit to the data, both the PSD and AV approaches can extract $\alpha$ and $\kappa$ in an unbiased and low-error manner, though the AV approach is simpler and more robust.},

LDP that is limited to early life transiently perturbs the microbiota, which is sufficient to induce sustained effects on body composition, indicating that microbiota interactions in infancy may be critical determinants of long-term host metabolic effects. In addition, LDP enhances the effect of high-fat diet induced obesity. The growth promotion phenotype is transferrable to germ-free hosts by LDP-selected microbiota, showing that the altered microbiota, not antibiotics per se, play a causal role. These studies characterize important variables in early-life microbe-host metabolic interaction and identify several taxa consistently linked with metabolic alterations.},

abstract = {Receptor-ligand bonds that mediate cell adhesion are often subjected to forces that regulate their dissociation via modulating off-rates. Off-rates control how long receptor-ligand bonds last and how much force they withstand. One should therefore be able to determine off-rates from either bond lifetime or unbinding force measurements. However, substantial discrepancies exist between the force dependence of off-rates derived from the two types of measurements even for the same interactions, e.g., selectins dissociating from their ligands, which mediate the tethering and rolling of leukocytes on vascular surfaces during inflammation and immune surveillance. We used atomic force microscopy to measure survival times of P-selectin dissociating from P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 or from an antibody in both bond lifetime and unbinding force experiments. By a new method of data analysis, we showed that the discrepancies resulted from the assumption that off-rates were functions of force only. The off-rates derived from forced dissociation data depended not only on force but also on the history of force application. This finding provides a new paradigm for understanding how force regulates receptor-ligand interactions.},

abstract = {The uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain 536 (O6:K15:H31) exhibits a mannose-resistant hemagglutination phenotype (Mrh) with bovine erythrocytes and delayed Mrh with human and guinea pig erythrocytes. Neuraminidase treatment of the erythrocytes abolishes mannose resistant hemagglutination, which is typical for X fimbriae. E. coli strain 536 synthesizes two different fimbriae (Fim phenotype) protein subunits, 16.5 and 22 kilodaltons in size. In addition the strain shows mannose-sensitive hemagglutination and common type I (F1) fimbriae. The cosmid clone E. coli K-12(pANN801) and another nine independently isolated Mrh+ cosmid clones derived from a cosmid gene bank of strain 536 express the 16.5-kilodalton protein band, but not the 22-kilodalton protein, indicating an association of the Mrh+ property with the "16.5-kilodalton fimbriae." All cosmid clones were fimbriated, and they reacted with antiserum produced against Mrh+ fimbriae of the E. coli strain HB101(pANN801) and lacked mannose-sensitive hemagglutination (F1) fimbriae. From the Mrh fim cosmid DNA pANN801, several subclones coding for hemagglutination and X fimbriae were constructed. Subclones that express both hemagglutination and fimbriae and subclones that only code for the hemagglutination antigen were isolated; subclones that only produce fimbriae were not detected. By transposon Tn5 mutagenesis we demonstrated that about 6.5 kilobases of DNA is required for the Mrh+ Fim+ phenotype, and the 1.5- to 2-kilobase DNA region coding for the structural protein of the fimbriae has been mapped adjacent to the region responsible for the Mrh+ phenotype. Two different regions can thus be distinguished in the adhesion determinant, one coding for hemagglutination and the other coding for fimbria formation. Transformation of plasmid DNA from these subclones into a Mrh- Fim- mutant of E. coli 536 and into a galE (rough) strain of Salmonella typhimurium yielded transformants that expressed both hemagglutination and fimbria production.},

We have now developed a novel more immunogenic ETEC vaccine based on recombinant non-toxigenic E. coli strains engineered to express increased amounts of CF antigens, including CS6 as well as an ETEC-based B subunit protein (LCTBA), and the optional combination with a nontoxic double-mutant heat-labile toxin (LT) molecule (dmLT) as an adjuvant. Two test vaccines were prepared under GMP: (1) A prototype E. coli CFA/I-only formalin-killed whole-cell+LCTBA vaccine, and (2) A "complete" inactivated multivalent ETEC-CF (CFA/I, CS3, CS5 and CS6 antigens) whole-cell+LCTBA vaccine. These vaccines, when given intragastrically alone or together with dmLT in mice, were well tolerated and induced strong intestinal-mucosal IgA antibody responses as well as serum IgG and IgA responses to each of the vaccine CF antigens as well as to LT B subunit (LTB). Both mucosal and serum responses were further enhanced (adjuvanted) when the vaccines were co-administered with dmLT. We conclude that the new multivalent oral ETEC vaccine, both alone and especially in combination with the dmLT adjuvant, shows great promise for further testing in humans.},

Conversely, it triggers the induction of the immune response, a process vital to the host's defence against infection. Adhesins are microbial cell surface molecules or structures that mediate the attachment of the microbe to host cells and, thus, the host-pathogen interaction. They also play a crucial role in bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation. In this review, we discuss the role of adhesins in the pathogenesis of the etiological agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We also provide insight into the structure and characteristics of some of the characterized and putative M. tuberculosis adhesins. Finally, we examine the potential of adhesins as targets for the development of TB control strategies.},

abstract = {The field of biomechanics tends focuses on suborganismal processes. Muscle kinetics, body and fin morphologies, and sensory systems characterize the mechanical interactions between fishes and their habitat. These in turn define the fishes' ability to exploit their environment, influencing not only home range, but also reproductive success, energetics, trophic interactions, and the scope of available habitats. Fisheries managers must take into account more than ecology and life history theory when developing policy: physiology, energetics, behavior, and stochastic habitat and ecosystem‐level processes must all be considered. The chapter discusses the current state of the field of fish biomechanics in a management context, identifying advances and gaps in knowledge that may both aid the development of sound management policies and provide helpful directions for future research. When developing conservation policy, managers often focus on critical life history stages: those parts of the life cycle that determine population-level processes. Many factors influence whether and in what condition fishes progress through these life stages. The chapter also presents a summary of gaps in current knowledge, with suggestions to how future biomechanics research might help to improve practices in both fisheries management and conservation.},

abstract = {Bacterial adhesion to surfaces mediated by specific adhesion organelles that promote infections, as exemplified by the pili of uropathogenic E. coli, is studied mostly at the level of cell-cell interactions and thereby reflects the averaged behavior of multiple pili. The role of pilus rod structure has therefore only been estimated from the outcome of experiments involving large numbers of organelles at the same time. It has, however, lately become clear that the biomechanical behavior of the pilus shafts play an important, albeit hitherto rather unrecognized, role in the adhesion process. For example, it has been observed that shafts from two different strains, even though they are similar in structure, result in large differences in the ability of the bacteria to adhere to their host tissue. However, in order to identify all properties of pilus structures that are of importance in the adhesion process, the biomechanical properties of pili must be assessed at the single-molecule level. Due to the low range of forces of these structures, until recently it was not possible to obtain such information. However, with the development of force-measuring optical tweezers (FMOT) with force resolution in the low piconewton range, it has lately become possible to assess forces mediated by individual pili on single living bacteria in real time. FMOT allows for a more or less detailed mapping of the biomechanical properties of individual pilus shafts, in particular those that are associated with their elongation and contraction under stress. This Mi- nireview presents the FMOT technique, the biological model system, and results from assessment of the biomechanical properties of bacterial pili. The information retrieved is also compared with that obtained by atomic force microscopy.},

The mechanical properties of skeletal and cardiac muscle titin were characterized in single molecules using a novel dual optical tweezers assay. Antibody pairs were attached to beads and used to select the whole molecule, I-band, A-band, a tandem-immunoglobulin (Ig) segment, and the PEVK region. A construct from the PEVK region expressing >25{\%} of the full-length skeletal muscle isoform was chemically conjugated to beads and similarly characterized. By elucidating the elasticity of the different regions, we showed directly for the first time, to our knowledge, that two entropic components act in series in the skeletal muscle titin I-band (confirming previous speculations), one associated with tandem-immunoglobulin domains and the other with the PEVK region, with persistence lengths of 2.9 nm and 0.76 nm, respectively (150 mM ionic strength, 22 degrees C). Novel findings were: the persistence length of the PEVK component rose (0.4-2.7 nm) with an increase in ionic strength (15-300 mM) and fell (3.0-0.3 nm) with a temperature increase (10-60 degrees C); stress-relaxation in 10-12-nm steps was observed in the PEVK construct and hysteresis in the native PEVK region. The region may not be a pure random coil, as previously thought, but contains structured elements, possibly with hydrophobic interactions.},

abstract = {The drag of a non-spherical particle was reviewed and investigated for a variety of shapes (regular and irregular) and particle Reynolds numbers (Rep). Point-force models for the trajectory-averaged drag were discussed for both the Stokes regime (Rep ??? 1) and Newton regime (Rep ??? 1 and sub-critical with approximately constant drag coefficient) for a particular particle shape. While exact solutions were often available for the Stokes regime, the Newton regime depended on: aspect ratio for spheroidal particles, surface area ratio for other regularly-shaped particles, and min-med-max area for irregularly shaped particles. The combination of the Stokes and Newton regimes were well integrated using a general method by Ganser (developed for isometric shapes and disks). In particular, a modified Clift-Gauvin expression was developed for particles with approximately cylindrical cross-sections relative to the flow, e.g. rods, prolate spheroids, and oblate spheroids with near-unity aspect ratios. However, particles with non-circular cross-sections exhibited a weaker dependence on Reynolds number, which is attributed to the more rapid transition to flow separation and turbulent boundary layer conditions. Their drag coefficient behavior was better represented by a modified Dallavalle drag model, by again integrating the Stokes and Newton regimes. This paper first discusses spherical particle drag and classification of particle shapes, followed by the main body which discusses drag in Stokes and Newton regimes and then combines these results for the intermediate regimes. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Desmin intermediate filaments play important role in the mechanical integrity and elasticity of muscle cells. The mechanisms of how desmin contributes to cellular mechanics are little understood. Here, we explored the nanomechanics of desmin by manipulating individual filaments with atomic force microscopy. In complex, hierarchical force responses we identified recurring features which likely correspond to distinct properties and structural transitions related to desmin's extensibility and elasticity. The most frequently observed feature is an initial unbinding transition that corresponds to the removal of ∼45-nm-long coiled-coil dimers from the filament surface with 20-60 pN forces in usually two discrete steps. In tethers longer than 60 nm we most often observed force plateaus studded with bumps spaced ∼16 nm apart, which are likely caused by a combination of protofilament unzipping, dimer-dimer sliding and coiled-coil-domain unfolding events. At high stresses and strains non-linear, entropic elasticity was dominant, and sometimes repetitive sawtooth force transitions were seen which might arise because of slippage within the desmin protofilament. A model is proposed in which mechanical yielding is caused by coiled-coil domain unfolding and dimer-dimer sliding/slippage, and strain hardening by the entropic elasticity of partially unfolded protofilaments. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Many Proteobacteria use the chaperone/usher pathway to assemble proteinaceous filaments on the bacterial surface. These filaments can curl into fimbrial or nonfimbrial surface structures (e.g., a capsule or spore coat). This article reviews the phylogeny of operons belonging to the chaperone/usher assembly class to explore the utility of establishing a scheme for subdividing them into clades of phylogenetically related gene clusters. Based on usher amino acid sequence comparisons, our analysis shows that the chaperone/usher assembly class is subdivided into six major phylogenetic clades, which we have termed alpha-, beta-, gamma-, kappa-, pi-, and sigma-fimbriae. Members of each clade share related operon structures and encode fimbrial subunits with similar protein domains. The proposed classification system offers a simple and convenient method for assigning newly discovered chaperone/usher systems to one of the six major phylogenetic groups.},

abstract = {Single-molecule manipulation studies have revealed that double-stranded DNA undergoes a structural transition when subjected to tension. At forces that depend on the attachment geometry of the DNA (65 pN or 110 pN), it elongates approximately 1.7-fold and its elastic properties change dramatically. The nature of this overstretched DNA has been under debate. In one model, the DNA cooperatively unwinds, while base pairing remains intact. In a competing model, the hydrogen bonds between base pairs break and two single DNA strands are formed, comparable to thermal DNA melting. Here, we resolve the structural basis of DNA overstretching using a combination of fluorescence microscopy, optical tweezers, and microfluidics. In DNA molecules undergoing the transition, we visualize double- and single-stranded segments using specific fluorescent labels. Our data directly demonstrate that overstretching comprises a gradual conversion from double-stranded to single-stranded DNA, irrespective of the attachment geometry. We found that these conversions favorably initiate from nicks or free DNA ends. These discontinuities in the phosphodiester backbone serve as energetically favorable nucleation points for melting. When both DNA strands are intact and no nicks or free ends are present, the overstretching force increases from 65 to 110 pN and melting initiates throughout the molecule, comparable to thermal melting. These results provide unique insights in the thermodynamics of DNA and DNA-protein interactions.},

This serves as a simple model system for describing laser trapping and manipulation of living cells and organelles within cells. The gradient and scattering forces are defined for beams of complex shape in the ray-optics limit. Forces are calculated over the entire cross-section of the sphere using TEM00 and TEM*00 mode input intensity profiles and spheres of varying index of refraction. Strong uniform traps are possible with force variations less than a factor of 2 over the sphere cross-section. For a laser power of 10 mW and a relative index of refraction of 1.2, we compute trapping forces as high as approximately 1.2 x 10(-6) dynes in the weakest (backward) direction of the gradient trap. It is shown that good trapping requires high convergence beams from a high numerical aperture objective. A comparison is given of traps made using bright field or differential interference contrast optics and phase contrast optics.},

Fluorescence fluctuations of DNA fragments labeled specifically at a single position reveal the time dependence of the DNA monomer's mean-square displacement <r(2)(t)>. The monomer motions within dsDNA and ssDNA coils are characterized by two qualitatively different kinetic regimes: close to <r(2)(t)> proportional to t(2/3) for ssDNA and <r(2)(t)> proportional to sqrt[t] for dsDNA. While the kinetic behavior of ssDNA is consistent with the generally accepted Zimm theory of polymer dynamics, the kinetic behavior of dsDNA monomers is in good agreement with the Rouse model.},

Comparing six Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates revealed significant differences in biofilm formation depending on the growth medium. Fimbriae are known to be involved in biofilm formation, and type 1, F1C and P fimbriae were seen to influence biofilm formation significantly different depending on strain background, growth media and aeration as well as surface material. Altogether, this report clearly demonstrates that biofilm formation of a given strain is highly dependent on experimental design and that specific mechanisms involved in biofilm formation such as fimbrial expression only play a role under certain environmental conditions. This study underscores the importance of careful selection of experimental conditions when investigating bacterial biofilm formation and to take great precaution/care when comparing results from different biofilm studies.},

Mannose-resistant hemagglutination-positive erythrocytes are more common among black donors than nonblack donors; tests with erythrocytes of known antigenic makeup confirm this correlation. Colonization factor antigen II receptor activity of mannose-resistant hemagglutination-positive erythrocytes is unstable when whole blood is stored at 4 degrees C. Also, screening of donors is best performed with enterotoxigenic E. coli possessing colonization factor antigen II composed of the coli surface antigen 1 (CS1) plus CS3, since these consistently produce stronger hemagglutination reactions than strains with colonization factor antigen II composed of either CS2 plus CS3 or CS3 only.},

Quantitative phase images of RBCs can be obtained by using off-axis DHM along to provide some important information about each RBC, including size, shape, volume, hemoglobin content, etc. The most important process of segmentation based on marker-controlled watershed is to perform an accurate localization of internal and external markers. Here, we first obtain the binary image via Otsu algorithm. Then, we apply morphological operations to the binary image to get the internal markers. We then apply the distance transform algorithm combined with the watershed algorithm to generate external markers based on internal markers. Finally, combining the internal and external markers, we modify the original gradient image and apply the watershed algorithm. By appropriately identifying the internal and external markers, the problems of oversegmentation and undersegmentation are avoided. Furthermore, the internal and external parts of the RBCs phase image can also be segmented by using the marker-controlled watershed combined with our method, which can identify the internal and external markers appropriately. Our experimental results show that the proposed method achieves good performance in terms of segmenting RBCs and could thus be helpful when combined with an automated classification of RBCs.},

abstract = {The Klebsiella pneumoniae type 3 fimbriae are mainly composed of MrkA pilins that assemble into a helixlike filament. This study determined the biomechanical properties of the fimbriae and analyzed 11 site-directed MrkA mutants to identify domains that are critical for the properties. Escherichia coli strains expressing type 3 fimbriae with an Ala substitution at either F34, V45, C87, G189, T196, or Y197 resulted in a significant reduction in biofilm formation. The E. coli strain expressing MrkAG189A remained capable of producing a normal number of fimbriae. Although F34A, V45A, T196A, and Y197A substitutions expressed on E. coli strains produced sparse quantities of fimbriae, no fimbriae were observed on the cells expressing MrkAC87A. Further investigations of the mechanical properties of the MrkAG189A fimbriae with optical tweezers revealed that, unlike the wild-type fimbriae, the uncoiling force for MrkAG189A fimbriae was not constant. The MrkAG189A fimbriae also exhibited a lower enthalpy in the differential scanning calorimetry analysis. Together, these findings indicate that the mutant fimbriae are less stable than the wild-type. This study has demonstrated that the C-terminal $\beta$ strands of MrkA are required for the assembly and structural stability of fimbriae.},

abstract = {When membrane-attached beads are pulled vertically by a laser tweezers, a membrane tube of constant diameter (tether) is formed. We found that the force on the bead (tether force) did not depend on tether length over a wide range of tether lengths, which indicates that a previously unidentified reservoir of membrane and not stretch of the plasma membrane provides the tether membrane. Plots of tether force vs. tether length have an initial phase, an elongation phase, and an exponential phase. During the major elongation phase, tether force is constant, buffered by the "membrane reservoir." Finally, there is an abrupt exponential rise in force that brings the tether out of the trap, indicating depletion of the membrane reservoir. In chick embryo fibroblasts and 3T3 fibroblasts, the maximum tether lengths that can be pulled at a velocity of 4 microm/s are 5.1 +/- 0. 3 and 5.0 +/- 0.2 microm, respectively. To examine the importance of the actin cytoskeleton, we treated cells with cytochalasin B or D and found that the tether lengths increased dramatically to 13.8 +/- 0.8 and 12.0 +/- 0.7 microm, respectively. Similarly, treatment of the cells with colchicine and nocodazole results in more than a twofold increase in tether length. We found that elevation of membrane tension (through osmotic pressure, a long-term elevation of tether force, or a number of transitory increases) increased reservoir size over the whole cell. Using a tracking system to hold tether force on the bead constant near its maximal length in the exponential phase, the rate of elongation of the tethers was measured as a function of tether force (membrane tension). The rate of elongation of tethers was linearly dependent on the tether force and reflected an increase in size of the reservoir. Increases in the reservoir caused by tension increases on one side of the cell caused increases in reservoir size on the other side of the cell. Thus, we suggest that cells maintain a plasma membrane reservoir to buffer against changes in membrane tension and that the reservoir is increased with membrane tension or disruption of the cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {The progression of a natural bacterial infection is a dynamic process influenced by the physiological characteristics of the target organ. Recent developments in live animal imaging allow for the study of the dynamic microbe-host interplay in real-time as the infection progresses within an organ of a live host. Here we used multiphoton microscopy-based live animal imaging, combined with advanced surgical procedures, to investigate the role of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) attachment organelles P and Type 1 fimbriae in renal bacterial infection. A GFP+ expressing variant of UPEC strain CFT073 and genetically well-defined isogenic mutants were microinfused into rat glomerulus or proximal tubules. Within 2 h bacteria colonized along the flat squamous epithelium of the Bowman's capsule despite being exposed to the primary filtrate. When facing the challenge of the filtrate flow in the proximal tubule, the P and Type 1 fimbriae appeared to act in synergy to promote colonization. P fimbriae enhanced early colonization of the tubular epithelium, while Type 1 fimbriae mediated colonization of the center of the tubule via a mechanism believed to involve inter-bacterial binding and biofilm formation. The heterogeneous bacterial community within the tubule subsequently affected renal filtration leading to total obstruction of the nephron within 8 h. Our results reveal the importance of physiological factors such as filtration in determining bacterial colonization patterns, and demonstrate that the spatial resolution of an infectious niche can be as small as the center, or periphery, of a tubule lumen. Furthermore, our data show how secondary physiological injuries such as obstruction contribute to the full pathophysiology of pyelonephritis.},

abstract = {We propose a new edge detection algorithm that works by computing a set of anchor edge points in an image and then linking these anchor points by drawing edges between them. The resulting edge map consists of perfect contiguous, one-pixel wide edges. The performance tests show that our algorithm is up to 16{\%} faster than the fastest known edge detection algorithm, i.e., OpenCV implementation of the Canny edge detector. We believe that our edge detector is a novel step in edge detection and would be very suitable for the next generation real-time image processing and computer vision applications.},

abstract = {The wormlike chain model describes the micromechanics of semiflexible polymers by introducing the persistence length. We propose a method of measuring the persistence length of DNA in a controllable near-native environment. Using a dark field microscope, the projected positions of a gold nanoparticle undergoing constrained Brownian motion are captured. The nanoparticle is tethered to a substrate using a single double stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule and immersed in buffer. No force is exerted on the DNA. We carried out Monte Carlo simulations of the experiment, which give insight into the micromechanics of the DNA and can be used to interpret the motion of the nanoparticle. Our simulations and experiments demonstrate that, unlike other similar experiments, the use of nanometer instead of micrometer sized particles causes particle-substrate and particle-DNA interactions to be of negligible effect on the position distribution of the particle. We also show that the persistence length of the tethering DNA can be estimated with a statistical error of 2 nm, by comparing the statistics of the projected position distribution of the nanoparticle to the Monte Carlo simulations. The persistence lengths of 45 single molecules of four different lengths of dsDNA were measured under the same environmental conditions at high salt concentration. The persistence lengths we found had a mean value of 35 nm (standard error of 2.8 nm), which compares well to previously found values using similar salt concentrations. Our method can be used to directly study the effect of the environmental conditions (e.g., buffer and temperature) on the persistence length.},

abstract = {Surface adhesion of bacteria generally occurs in the presence of shear stress, and the lifetime of receptor bonds is expected to be shortened in the presence of external force. However, by using Escherichia coli expressing the lectin-like adhesin FimH and guinea pig erythrocytes in flow chamber experiments, we show that bacterial attachment to target cells switches from loose to firm upon a 10-fold increase in shear stress applied. Steered molecular dynamics simulations of tertiary structure of the FimH receptor binding domain and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that shear-enhancement of the FimH-receptor interactions involves extension of the interdomain linker chain under mechanical force. The ability of FimH to function as a force sensor provides a molecular mechanism for discrimination between surface-exposed and soluble receptor molecules.},

abstract = {ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to reposition and reconfigure nucleosomes. Despite their diverse functions, all remodellers share highly conserved ATPase domains, many shown to translocate DNA. Understanding remodelling requires biophysical knowledge of the DNA translocation process: how the ATPase moves DNA and generates force, and how translocation and force generation are coupled on nucleosomes. Here, we characterize the real-time activity of a minimal RSC translocase 'motor' on bare DNA, using high-resolution optical tweezers and a 'tethered' translocase system. We observe on dsDNA a processivity of ∼35 bp, a speed of ∼25 bp/s, and a step size of 2.0 (±0.4, s.e.m.) bp. Surprisingly, the motor is capable of moving against high force, up to 30 pN, making it one of the most force-resistant motors known. We also provide evidence for DNA 'buckling' at initiation. These observations reveal the ATPase as a powerful DNA translocating motor capable of disrupting DNA-histone interactions by mechanical force.},

abstract = {We characterize the frequency-dependent response of a photo detection system based on a Si-PIN photodiode and a laser with wavelength 1064 nm, a system commonly used with optical tweezers. We chopped the laser beam with chopper frequencies from 200 Hz to 14 kHz, and found an exponentially delayed response of the detection system with a characteristic delay time of similar to20 mus. The physical mechanism causing this time delay is silicon's transparency to 1064 nm light: Photons are absorbed and create charge carriers not only in the diode's depletion layer, where they are detected within nano-seconds, but predominantly in the n-layer, where they remain undetected till transported out by thermal diffusion. The diode's response is dominated by this delay which can be characterized as a first-order low-pass filter with a 3dB-frequency of 8-9 kHz, depending on laser intensity. Measurements exploiting frequencies near or above this 3dB-frequency must be corrected for this unintended filter effect. We describe how to do this, and how to diagnose other systems which may or may not have the same problem. Explanations are intended for users of photo detection systems, and present the little semi-conductor physics needed to make sense. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

We used laser tweezers to investigate the dynamics of individual pili of Neisseria gonorrheae at clamped forces between 8 pN and 100 pN and at varying concentration of the retraction ATPase PilT. The elongation probability of individual pili increased with increasing mechanical force. Directional switching occurred on two distinct timescales, and regular stepping was absent on a scale > 3 nm. We found that the retraction velocity is bimodal and that the bimodality depends on force and on the concentration of PilT proteins. We conclude that the pilus motor is a multistate system with at least one polymerization mode and two depolymerization modes with the dynamics fine-tuned by force and PilT concentration.},

@article{Peterman2003,
abstract = {In an optical tweezers experiment intense laser light is tightly focused to intensities of MW/cm(2) in order to apply forces to submicron particles or to measure mechanical properties of macromolecules. It is important to quantify potentially harmful or misleading heating effects due to the high light intensities in biophysical experiments. We present a model that incorporates the geometry of the experiment in a physically correct manner, including heat generation by light absorption in the neighborhood of the focus, balanced by outward heat flow, and heat sinking by the glass surfaces of the sample chamber. This is in contrast to the earlier simple models assuming heat generation in the trapped particle only. We find that in the most common experimental circumstances, using micron-sized polystyrene or silica beads, absorption of the laser light in the solvent around the trapped particle, not in the particle itself, is the most important contribution to heating. To validate our model we measured the spectrum of the Brownian motion of trapped beads in water and in glycerol as a function of the trapping laser intensity. Heating both increases the thermal motion of the bead and decreases the viscosity of the medium. We measured that the temperature in the focus increased by 34.2 +/- 0.1 K/W with 1064-nm laser light for 2200-nm-diameter polystyrene beads in glycerol, 43.8 +/- 2.2 K/W for 840-nm polystyrene beads in glycerol, 41.1 +/- 0.7 K/W for 502-nm polystyrene beads in glycerol, and 7.7 +/- 1.2 K/W for 500-nm silica beads and 8.1 +/- 2.1 K/W for 444-nm silica beads in water. Furthermore, we observed that in glycerol the heating effect increased when the bead was trapped further away from the cover glass/glycerol interface as predicted by the model. We show that even though the heating effect in water is rather small it can have non-negligible effects on trap calibration in typical biophysical experimental circumstances and should be taken into consideration when laser powers of more than 100 mW are used.},

abstract = {Types 1 and P pili are prototypical bacterial cell-surface appendages playing essential roles in mediating adhesion of bacteria to the urinary tract. These pili, assembled by the chaperone-usher pathway, are polymers of pilus subunits assembling into two parts: a thin, short tip fibrillum at the top, mounted on a long pilus rod. The rod adopts a helical quaternary structure and is thought to play essential roles: its formation may drive pilus extrusion by preventing backsliding of the nascent growing pilus within the secretion pore; the rod also has striking spring-like properties, being able to uncoil and recoil depending on the intensity of shear forces generated by urine flow. Here, we present an atomic model of the P pilus generated from a 3.8 {\AA} resolution cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction. This structure provides the molecular basis for the rod's remarkable mechanical properties and illuminates its role in pilus secretion.

The performance and stability of the numerical method are analyzed in details and found to meet the requirements of interactive heavy hoisting simulations. The physical model is well behaved in the limit of infinite stiffness as well as in the elastic regime, and the tuning parameters correspond directly to conventional material constants. The integration scheme mixes the well known St{\"{o}}rmer-Verlet method for the dynamics equations with the linearly implicit Euler method for the constraint equations and enables physical constraint relaxation and stabilization terms. The technique is shown to have superior numerical stability properties in comparison with either chain link systems, or spring and damper models. Experimental results are presented to show that the method results in stable, real-time simulations. Stability persists for moderately large fixed integration step of Delta t = 1/60 s, with hoisting loads of up to 10(5) times heavier than the elements of the cable. Further numerical experiments validating the physical model are also presented.},

Ultrastructural studies revealed bacteria adherent to mucosal cells with flattening of microvilli, loss of the cellular terminal web, and cupping of the plasma membrane around individual bacteria.

abstract = {Adherence to host tissues mediated by pili is pivotal in the establishment of infection by many bacterial pathogens. Corynebacterium diphtheriae assembles on its surface three distinct pilus structures. The function and the mechanism of how various pili mediate adherence, however, have remained poorly understood. Here we show that the SpaA-type pilus is sufficient for the specific adherence of corynebacteria to human pharyngeal epithelial cells. The deletion of the spaA gene, which encodes the major pilin forming the pilus shaft, abolishes pilus assembly but not adherence to pharyngeal cells. In contrast, adherence is greatly diminished when either minor pilin SpaB or SpaC is absent. Antibodies directed against either SpaB or SpaC block bacterial adherence. Consistent with a direct role of the minor pilins, latex beads coated with SpaB or SpaC protein bind specifically to pharyngeal cells. Therefore, tissue tropism of corynebacteria for pharyngeal cells is governed by specific minor pilins. Importantly, immunoelectron microscopy and immunofluorescence studies reveal clusters of minor pilins that are anchored to cell surface in the absence of a pilus shaft. Thus, the minor pilins may also be cell wall anchored in addition to their incorporation into pilus structures that could facilitate tight binding to host cells during bacterial infection.},

By replacing the photodiode with a CCD camera, we obtain detailed information on the light scattered by the microsphere. The correlation of the interference pattern with the axial position displays complex behavior with regions of positive and negative interference. By analyzing the scattered light intensity as a function of the axial position of the trapped sphere, we propose a simple method to increase the sensitivity and control the linear range of axial position detection.},

@article{Yakovenko2008a,
abstract = {The bacterial adhesive protein, FimH, is the most common adhesin of Escherichia coli and mediates weak adhesion at low flow but strong adhesion at high flow. There is evidence that this occurs because FimH forms catch bonds, defined as bonds that are strengthened by tensile mechanical force. Here, we applied force to single isolated FimH bonds with an atomic force microscope in order to test this directly. If force was loaded slowly, most of the bonds broke up at low force (<60 piconewtons of rupture force). However, when force was loaded rapidly, all bonds survived until much higher force (140-180 piconewtons of rupture force), behavior that indicates a catch bond. Structural mutations or pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody, both of which allosterically stabilize a high affinity conformation of FimH, cause all bonds to survive until high forces regardless of the rate at which force is applied. Pretreatment of FimH bonds with intermediate force has the same strengthening effect on the bonds. This demonstrates that FimH forms catch bonds and that tensile force induces an allosteric switch to the high affinity, strong binding conformation of the adhesin. The catch bond behavior of FimH, the amount of force needed to regulate FimH, and the allosteric mechanism all provide insight into how bacteria bind and form biofilms in fluid flow. Additionally, these observations may provide a means for designing antiadhesive mechanisms.},

abstract = {Antipili antibody (APA) was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the serum, urine, and vaginal secretions of 12 women with cystitis due to Escherichia coli. Pili were purified from the strain infecting each patient. The geometric mean titers of APA in serum taken at the initial visit were: immunoglobulin G (IgG), 23.7 +/- 3.9; IgA, 4.1 +/- 4.0; and IgM, 4.4 +/- 5.7. No consistent change was observed between samples obtained at 3 and 6 weeks. APA in serum from 10 control patients was assayed against a pool of pili assembled from the 12 infecting isolates. The geometric mean titers of the control sera were: IgG, 8.4 +/- 3.2; IgA, 9.6 +/- 2.4; and IgM, 0. Antipili IgG and IgM were significantly greater in the infected than in the control sera (P less than 0.05). APA was not detected in the urine or vaginal secretions from any infected or control patient. Antigenic relationships between the 12 infecting strains were investigated by indirect immune electron microscopy. All but 1 of 12 infecting strains shared antigenic determinants. Two patients had a second E. coli infection during the study. The pili of the reinfecting isolates showed partial antigenic cross-reactivity with the pili of the initial infecting bacteria. These observations indicate that although cystitis stimulates the development of serum APAs, it fails to stimulate local APA and thus may not engender any immunological barrier to subsequent recolonization.},

abstract = {Infection caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) poses a serious health problem among children and adults in developing countries. Colonization of the small intestinal mucosa by ETEC strains is mediated by antigenically specific fimbriae, also known as colonization factor antigens (CFA). The significance of this study arises from reports that active and passive immunization with ETEC strains harboring CFAs has previously been shown to induce protective immunity against diarrhea in animal models. The aim of this study was to determine toxin-associated CFAs of ETEC isolated from a diarrheal disease case-control study in Jakarta, Indonesia. Thirteen hundred and twenty-three diarrheic and control patients with lactose-fermenting colonies were screened by ganglioside GM1-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (GM1-ELISA) for heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) toxins. Two hundred and forty-six (19{\%}) ETEC isolates identified by GM1-ELISA for the LT/ST toxins were screened for CFAs by Dot blot assay using monoclonal antibodies against CFA/I, II, and IV and against the putative colonization antigens (PCF) PCFO159, PCFO166, CS7, and CS17. Of the 246 ETEC isolates, 177 (72{\%}) elaborated ST, 56 (23{\%}) produced LT, while 13 (5{\%}) elicited both the ST and LT toxins. CFA testing of the 246 ETEC isolates showed that 21 (8{\%}) expressed CFA/I, 3 (1{\%}) exhibited CFA/II, 14 (6{\%}) elaborated CFA/IV, while 7 (3{\%}) expressed PCFO159 and PCFO159 plus CS5. No CFAs or PCFs could be associated with 201 (82{\%}) of the ETEC strains. This report documents the types of CFAs associated with ETEC strains in Jakarta, Indonesia. These data may help current research efforts on the development of CFA-based vaccines for humans against ETEC and provide additional information for future ETEC vaccine trials in Southeast Asia.},

@article{Evans2004,
abstract = {Many biomolecular bonds exhibit a mechanical strength that increases in proportion to the logarithm of the rate of force application. Consistent with exponential decrease in bond lifetime under rising force, this kinetically limited failure reflects dissociation along a single thermodynamic pathway impeded by a sharp free energy barrier. Using a sensitive force probe to test the leukocyte adhesion bond P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1)-P-selectin, we observed a linear increase of bond strength with each 10-fold increase in the rate of force application from 300 to 30,000 pN/sec, implying a single pathway for failure. However, the strength and lifetime of PSGL-1-P-selectin bonds dropped anomalously when loaded below 300 pN/sec, demonstrating unexpectedly faster dissociation and a possible second pathway for failure. Remarkably, if first loaded by a "jump" in force to 20-30 pN, the bonds became strong when subjected to a force ramp as slow as 30 pN/sec and exhibited the same single-pathway kinetics under all force rates. Applied in this way, a new "jump/ramp" mode of force spectroscopy was used to show that the PSGL-1-P-selectin bond behaves as a mechanochemical switch where force history selects between two dissociation pathways with markedly different properties. Furthermore, replacing PSGL-1 by variants of its 19-aa N terminus and by the crucial tetrasaccharide sialyl LewisX produces dramatic changes in the failure kinetics, suggesting a structural basis for the two pathways. The two-pathway switch seems to provide a mechanism for the "catch bond" response observed recently with PSGL-1-P-selectin bonds subjected to small-constant forces.},

This is a nontrivial task, as many of the physical characteristics of the medium and probe, e.g., viscosity, elasticity, shape, and density, are often unknown. Here, we suggest how to calibrate single beam optical tweezers in a complex viscoelastic environment. At the same time, we determine viscoelastic characteristics such as friction retardation spectrum and elastic moduli of the medium. We apply and test a method suggested [M. Fischer and K. Berg-S{\o}rensen, J. Opt. A, Pure Appl. Opt. 9, S239 (2007)], a method which combines passive and active measurements. The method is demonstrated in a simple viscous medium, water, and in a solution of entangled F-actin without cross-linkers.},

abstract = {Self-associating auto-transporter (SAAT) adhesins are two-domain cell surface proteins involved in bacteria auto-aggregation and biofilm formation. Antigen 43 (Ag43) is a SAAT adhesin commonly found in Escherichia coli whose variant Ag43a has been shown to promote persistence of uropathogenic E. coli within the bladder. The recent resolution of the tri-dimensional structure of the 499 amino-acids' $\beta$-domain in Ag43a has shed light on the possible mechanism governing the self-recognition of SAAT adhesins, in particular the importance of trans-interactions between the L shaped $\beta$-helical scaffold of two $\alpha$-domains of neighboring adhesins. In this study, we use single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) and dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS) to unravel the dynamics of Ag43-self association under various pH and molecular elongation rate conditions that mimic the situations encountered by E. coli in its natural environment. Results evidenced an important stretchability of Ag43$\alpha$ with unfolding of sub-domains leading to molecular extension as long as 150 nm. Nanomechanical analysis of molecular stretching data suggested that self-association of Ag43 can lead to the formation of dimers and tetramers driven by rapid and weak cis- as well as slow but strong trans-interaction forces with a magnitude as large as 100-250 pN. The dynamics of cis- and trans-interactions were demonstrated to be strongly influenced by pH and applied shear force, thus suggesting that environmental conditions can modulate Ag43-mediated aggregation of bacteria at the molecular level.},

The modified beads were trapped at defined positions close to a pair of integrated planar gold microelectrodes within the channel, using optical tweezers. Both transient and steady-state electrochemical potentials were applied to the microelectrode pair in order to generate changes in the local pH, associated with electrolysis. The functionalised beads indicated the pH changes in the channel, measured as a change in the fluorescence signal, generated by the immobilised pH sensitive dye. Responses were measured with temporal resolutions of between 1 and 200 ms, whilst the spatial resolution of the pH gradients was limited by the size of the beads to 3 microm.},

First, the basic results from the general theory of holography, based on the scalar diffraction theory, are summarized, and a general description of the digital holographic microscopy process is given, including quantitative phase microscopy. Several numerical diffraction methods are described and compared, and a number of representative configurations used in digital holography are described, including off-axis Fresnel, Fourier, image plane, in-line, Gabor, and phase-shifting digital holographies. Then we survey numerical techniques that give rise to unique capabilities of digital holography, including suppression of dc and twin image terms, pixel resolution control, optical phase unwrapping, aberration compensation, and others. A survey is also given of representative application areas, including biomedical microscopy, particle field holography, micrometrology, and holographic tomography, as well as some of the special techniques, such as holography of total internal reflection, optical scanning holography, digital interference holography, and heterodyne holography. The review is intended for students and new researchers interested in developing new techniques and exploring new applications of digital holography.},

abstract = {A novel, non-invasive method to diagnose bladder outlet obstruction involves the recording of noise with a contact microphone pressed against the perineum (between anus and scrotum). This noise results from flow-generated vortices caused by prostatic obstruction. We developed a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) urethral model including urethral geometry to study the relation between generated noise and the degree of obstruction. This model comprised a bladder, bladder neck, prostate and urethra. Calculations were carried out at four bladder pressures, five degrees of obstruction and three obstruction shapes. For each of the sixty simulations, the velocity and pressure distributions along the urethra were calculated including wall shear stresses to localize flow transition from disturbed to normal. Negative pressures at the obstruction outlet induced recirculation of flow. The location of transition was independent of the applied bladder pressure, but it depended primarily on the degree and secondarily on the shape of the obstruction. Based on the presented results, we hypothesize that the location of the maximum amplitude of perineal noise mainly depends on the degree and shape of the prostatic obstruction. Our future aim is to test our hypothesis in male patients and to extend the presented model to 3D with a viscoelastic urethral wall to calculate the fluid-wall interaction.},

abstract = {Protein levels have been shown to vary substantially between individual cells in clonal populations. In prokaryotes, the contribution to such fluctuations from the inherent randomness of gene expression has largely been attributed to having just a few transcripts of the corresponding mRNAs. By contrast, eukaryotic studies tend to emphasize chromatin remodeling and burst-like transcription. Here, we study single-cell transcription in Escherichia coli by measuring mRNA levels in individual living cells. The results directly demonstrate transcriptional bursting, similar to that indirectly inferred for eukaryotes. We also measure mRNA partitioning at cell division and correlate mRNA and protein levels in single cells. Partitioning is approximately binomial, and mRNA-protein correlations are weaker earlier in the cell cycle, where cell division has recently randomized the relative concentrations. Our methods further extend protein-based approaches by counting the integer-valued number of transcript with single-molecule resolution. This greatly facilitates kinetic interpretations in terms of the integer-valued random processes that produce the fluctuations.},

A subgroup of Escherichia coli, which cause urinary tract infection, bacteremia, sepsis, and meningitis, have adapted to grow as a harmless commensal in the nutrient-replete, carbon-rich human intestine but rapidly transition to pathogenic lifestyle in the nutritionally poorer, nitrogen-rich urinary tract.

abstract = {Microbial adhesion to surfaces and interfaces is strongly influenced by their structure and physicochemical properties. We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to measure the forces between chemically functionalized AFM tips and two bacterial species exhibiting different cell surface hydrophobicities, measured as the oil/water contact angle (theta): Acinetobacter venetianus RAG-1 (theta = 56.4 degrees ) and Rhodococcus erythropolis 20S-E1-c (theta = 152.9 degrees ). The forces were measured as the AFM tips, coated with either hydrophobic (octadecane) or hydrophilic (undecanol) groups, approached the bacterial cells in aqueous buffer. The experimental force curves between the two microbial cells and functionalized AFM probes were not successfully described by the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory of colloid stability. To reconcile the discrepancy between theory and experiments, two types of extended DLVO models were proposed. The first modification considers an additional acid-base component that accounts for attractive hydrophobic interactions and repulsive hydration effects. The second model considers an additional exponentially decaying steric interaction between polymeric brushes in addition to the acid-base interactions. These extended DLVO predictions agreed well with AFM experimental data for both A. venetianus RAG-1, whose surface consists of an exopolymeric capsule and pili, and R. erythropolis 20S-E1-c, whose surface is covered by an exopolymeric capsule. The extended models for the bacteria-AFM tip force-distance curves were consistent with the effects of steric interactions.},

Optical tweezers are now being used in the investigation of an increasing number of biochemical and biophysical processes, from the basic mechanical properties of biological polymers to the multitude of molecular machines that drive the internal dynamics of the cell. Innovation, however, continues in all areas of instrumentation and technique, with much of this work focusing on the refinement of established methods and on the integration of this tool with other forms of single-molecule manipulation or detection. Although technical in nature, these developments have important implications for the expanded use of optical tweezers in biochemical research and thus should be of general interest.

abstract = {In dynamic force spectroscopy, access to the characteristic parameters of single molecular bonds requires nontrivial measurements and data processing as the rupture forces are found not only to be distributed over a wide range, but are also dependent on the loading rate. The choice of measurement procedure and data processing methods has a considerable impact on the accuracy and precision of the final results. We analyze, by means of numerical simulations, methods to minimize and assess the magnitude of the expected errors for different combinations of experimental and evaluation methods. It was found that the choice of fitting function is crucial to extract correct parameter values. Applying a Gaussian function, which is a common practice, is equivalent to introducing a systematic error, and leads to a consequent overestimation of the thermal off-rate by more than 30{\%}. We found that the precision of the bond length and the thermal off-rate, in presence of unbiased noise, were improved by reducing the number of loading rates for a given number of measurements. Finally, the results suggest that the minimum number of measurements needed to obtain the bond strength, with acceptable precision, exceeds the common number of approximately 100 reported in literature.},

abstract = {High shear enhances the adhesion of Escherichia coli bacteria binding to mannose coated surfaces via the adhesin FimH, raising the question as to whether FimH forms catch bonds that are stronger under tensile mechanical force. Here, we study the length of time that E. coli pause on mannosylated surfaces and report a double exponential decay in the duration of the pauses. This double exponential decay is unlike previous single molecule or whole cell data for other catch bonds, and indicates the existence of two distinct conformational states. We present a mathematical model, derived from the common notion of chemical allostery, which describes the lifetime of a catch bond in which mechanical force regulates the transitions between two conformational states that have different unbinding rates. The model explains these characteristics of the data: a double exponential decay, an increase in both the likelihood and lifetime of the high-binding state with shear stress, and a biphasic effect of force on detachment rates. The model parameters estimated from the data are consistent with the force-induced structural changes shown earlier in FimH. This strongly suggests that FimH forms allosteric catch bonds. The model advances our understanding of both catch bonds and the role of allostery in regulating protein activity.},

abstract = {Macromolecules and cells exposed to blood flow in the circulatory tree experience hydrodynamic forces that affect their structure and function. After introducing the general theory of the effects of shear forces on protein conformation, selected examples are presented in this review for biological macromolecules sensitive to shear stress. In particular, the biochemical effects of shear stress in controlling the von Willebrand Factor (VWF) conformation are extensively described. This protein, together with blood platelets, is the main actor of the early steps of primary haemostasis. Under the effect of shear forces >30 dyn/cm², VWF unfolding occurs and the protein exhibits an extended chain conformation oriented in the general direction of the shear stress field. The stretched VWF conformation favors also a process of self aggregation, responsible for the formation of a spider web network, particularly efficient in the trapping process of flowing platelets. Thus, the effect of shear stress on conformational changes in VWF shows a close structure-function relationship in VWF for platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in arterial circulation, where high shear stress is present. The investigation of biophysical effects of shear forces on VWF conformation contributes to unraveling the molecular interaction mechanisms involved in arterial thrombosis.},

abstract = {An oral, live attenuated, three-strain recombinant bacterial vaccine, ACE527, was demonstrated to generate strong immune responses to colonization factor and toxin antigens of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) in human volunteers. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated at doses of up to 10(11) CFU, administered in each of two doses given 21 days apart. These observations have now been extended in a phase 2b study with a total of 70 subjects. Fifty-six of these subjects were challenged 28 days after the second dose of vaccine with the highly virulent ETEC strain H10407 to obtain preliminary indicators of efficacy against disease and to support further development of the vaccine for both travelers and infants in countries where ETEC is endemic. The vaccine had a significant impact on intestinal colonization by the challenge strain, as measured by quantitative fecal culture 2 days after challenge, demonstrating the induction of a functional immune response to the CFA/I antigen. The incidence and severity of diarrhea were also reduced in vaccinees as measured by a number of secondary and ad hoc endpoints, although the 27{\%} reduction seen in the primary endpoint, moderate to severe diarrhea, was not statistically significant. Together, these observations support the hypothesis that the ACE527 vaccine has a dual mode of action, targeting both colonization factors and the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT), and suggest that it should be further developed for more advanced trials to evaluate its impact on the burden of ETEC disease in field settings.},

@article{Anderson2007,
abstract = {Bacterial adhesion to and subsequent colonization of surfaces are the first steps toward forming biofilms, which are a major concern for implanted medical devices and in many diseases. It has generally been assumed that strong irreversible adhesion is a necessary step for biofilm formation. However, some bacteria, such as Escherichia coli when binding to mannosylated surfaces via the adhesive protein FimH, adhere weakly in a mode that allows them to roll across the surface. Since single-point mutations or even increased shear stress can switch this FimH-mediated adhesion to a strong stationary mode, the FimH system offers a unique opportunity to investigate the role of the strength of adhesion independently from the many other factors that may affect surface colonization. Here we compare levels of surface colonization by E. coli strains that differ in the strength of adhesion as a result of flow conditions or point mutations in FimH. We show that the weak rolling mode of surface adhesion can allow a more rapid spreading during growth on a surface in the presence of fluid flow. Indeed, an attempt to inhibit the adhesion of strongly adherent bacteria by blocking mannose receptors with a soluble inhibitor actually increased the rate of surface colonization by allowing the bacteria to roll. This work suggests that (i) a physiological advantage to the weak adhesion demonstrated by commensal variants of FimH bacteria may be to allow rapid surface colonization and (ii) antiadhesive therapies intended to prevent biofilm formation can have the unintended effect of enhancing the rate of surface colonization.},

abstract = {A common mechanism used by bacteria to initiate adhesion to host tissues during colonization is the expression of long filamentous structures extending from their surface. These structures, known as pili or fimbriae, were initially identified in Gram-negative bacteria, and are typically formed by noncovalent interactions between pilin subunits. Pili have only recently been described in Gram-positive bacteria. In particular, in pathogenic streptococci the proteinaceous components of pili are covalently polymerized by the action of sortase enzymes similar to those involved in the covalent attachment of Gram-positive surface proteins to the peptidoglycan cell wall. With great relevance to the development of strategies to combat Gram-positive-associated infections, pilus components from pathogenic streptococci have been shown to induce protective immunity in mouse models of streptococcal disease. In addition, recent papers have created new perspectives on the role of such organelles in streptococcal pathogenesis, from the involvement in colonization and biofilm formation to translocation of tissue barriers. All this information makes the characterization of pili a hot scientific issue that we believe will lead to important future developments in understanding bacterial dynamics that lead to successful occupation of microbial niches.},

abstract = {To be virulent, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) must produce a toxin and a pilus-like structure that mediates specific attachment to host tissue. Expression of two of these specific adherence structures, CS1 and CS2, requires the presence of a plasmid in an ETEC strain of a particular serotype and biotype. We show here that this plasmid does not contain the structural gene for a pilin protein, as previously believed. Instead we have identified a plasmid-encoded gene called rns that is required for expression of CS1 or CS2 colonization factor antigens and for adhesion. The rns gene, defined by two separately isolated insertion mutations, produces a 26-kDa protein when transcribed and translated in vitro. At the protein level the rns gene product is homologous to AraC, a positive regulator of the arabinose operon of enteric bacteria, and to RhaR and RhaS, which regulate the rhamnose operon of E. coli. The homology of the Rns protein to AraC is localized to regions that are believed to bind to DNA. Moreover, the sequence of one of these homologous regions is consistent with a DNA binding helix-turn-helix motif. The average G + C content of E. coli DNA is 50{\%}; yet the rns gene contains only 28{\%} G + C, suggesting that it was acquired from some other organism.},

abstract = {The results of a theoretical and experimental investigation of the Gouy effect in Bessel beams are presented. We point out that the peculiar feature of the Bessel beams of being nondiffracting is related to the accumulation of an extra axial phase shift (i.e., the Gouy phase shift) linearly dependent on the propagation distance. The constant spatial rate of variation of the Gouy phase shift is independent of the order of the Bessel beam, while it is a growing function of the transverse component of the angular spectrum wave-vectors, originated by the transverse confinement of the beam. A free-space Mach-Zehnder interferometer has been set-up for measuring the transverse intensity distribution of the interference between holographically-produced finite-aperture Bessel beams of order from zero up to three and a reference Gaussian beam, at a wavelength of 633 nm. The interference patterns have been registered for different propagation distances and show a spatial periodicity, in agreement with the expected period due to the linear increase of the Gouy phase shift of the realized Bessel beams.},

By combining sucrose density gradient (SDG) centrifugation and bacterial DNA quantification it was found which strains of L. reuteri were more strongly associated with the dairy products, and the results were corroborated by direct binding rate and force measurements made with optical tweezers. It was determined that strong binding was associated with hydrophobicity of the bacteria and that this hydrophobicity is correlated with the presence of LiCl-extractable protein on the surface of the bacteria. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) allowed for the visualization of interactions between bacteria and MFGM. This study demonstrates that these methods can be used in combination to characterize, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the adhesion of lactic acid bacteria strains in dairy products.},

During pilus assembly, FimD binds complexes between the chaperone FimC and type 1 pilus subunits in the periplasm and mediates subunit translocation to the cell surface. Here we report nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray protein structures of the N-terminal substrate recognition domain of FimD (FimD(N)) before and after binding of a chaperone-subunit complex. FimD(N) consists of a flexible N-terminal segment of 24 residues, a structured core with a novel fold, and a C-terminal hinge segment. In the ternary complex, residues 1-24 of FimD(N) specifically interact with both FimC and the subunit, acting as a sensor for loaded FimC molecules. Together with in vivo complementation studies, we show how this mechanism enables recognition and discrimination of different chaperone-subunit complexes by bacterial pilus assembly platforms.},

Here we used a numerical method to solve for the flow generated by moving walls to assess occlusive contractions (case 1), nonocclusive contractions (case 2), and contractions with steep shoulders (case 3) for which visual parameters of wall movements are published. We found that all three contraction cases produced pressure differentials across the coapting segment, downstream and reverse flow, and vortical flow patterns that redistributed particles and mixed liquids. Contractions generated pressures and shear stresses, particularly along the moving section of the wall. The nonocclusive contraction was much less effective than the occlusive contraction with the steep shoulders; the occlusive contraction with flat shoulders had an intermediate effect. Our analysis shows that even peristaltic contractions produce not only laminar flow but also many flow events likely to promote digestion and absorption. The visual patterns of contractions impact the patterns of luminal flow, and precise definition of wall movements is critical to quantify the fluid mechanical consequences of intestinal contractions.},

abstract = {The pili expressed by Streptococcus pyogenes and certain other Gram-positive bacterial pathogens are based on a polymeric backbone in which individual pilin subunits are joined end-to-end by covalent isopeptide bonds through the action of sortase enzymes. The crystal structure of the major pilin of S. pyogenes, Spy0128, revealed that each domain of the two domain protein contained an intramolecular isopeptide bond cross-link joining a Lys side chain to an Asn side chain. In the present work, mutagenesis was used to create mutant proteins that lacked either one isopeptide bond (E117A, N168A, and E258A mutants) or both isopeptide bonds (E117A/E258A). Both the thermal stability and proteolytic stability of Spy0128 were severely compromised by loss of the isopeptide bonds. Unfolding experiments, monitored by circular dichroism, revealed a transition temperature T(m) of 85 degrees C for the wild type protein. In contrast, mutants with only one isopeptide bond showed biphasic unfolding, with the domain lacking an isopeptide bond having a T(m) that was approximately 30 degrees C lower than the unaltered domain. High resolution crystal structures of the E117A and N168A mutants showed that the loss of an isopeptide bond did not change the overall pilin structure but caused local disturbance of the protein core that was greater for E117A than for N168A. These effects on stability appear also to be important for pilus assembly.},

abstract = {The TATA-box binding protein (TBP) is required by all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases for the initiation of transcription from most promoters. TBP recognizes, binds to, and bends promoter sequences called "TATA-boxes" in the DNA. We present results from the study of individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae TBPs interacting with single DNA molecules containing a TATA-box. Using video microscopy, we observed the Brownian motion of beads tethered by short surface-bound DNA. When TBP binds to and bends the DNA, the conformation of the DNA changes and the amplitude of Brownian motion of the tethered bead is reduced compared to that of unbent DNA. We detected individual binding and dissociation events and derived kinetic parameters for the process. Dissociation was induced by increasing the salt concentration or by directly pulling on the tethered bead using optical tweezers. In addition to the well-defined free and bound classes of Brownian motion, we observed another two classes of motion. These extra classes were identified with intermediate states on a three-step, linear-binding pathway. Biological implications of the intermediate states are discussed.},

abstract = {In a nanoscale system out of thermodynamic equilibrium, it is important to account for thermal fluctuations. Typically, the thermal noise contributes fluctuations, e.g., of distances that are substantial in comparison to the size of the system and typical distances measured. If the thermal fluctuations are ignored, misinterpretation of measured quantities such as interaction forces, potentials, and constants may result. Here, we consider a particle moving in a time-dependent landscape, as, e.g., in an optical tweezers or atomic force nanoscopic measurement. Based on the Kramers equation [H. A. Kramers, Physica 7, 284 (1940)], we propose an approximate but quantitative way of dealing with such an out-of-equilibrium system. The limits of this approximate description of the escape process are determined through optical tweezers experiments and comparison to simulations. Also, this serves as a recipe for how to use the proposed method to obtain knowledge about the underlying energy landscape from a set of experimental measurements. Finally, we perform estimates of the error made if thermal fluctuations are ignored.},

abstract = {Secretory IgA (SIgA) serves as the first line of defense in protecting the intestinal epithelium from enteric toxins and pathogenic microorganisms. Through a process known as immune exclusion, SIgA promotes the clearance of antigens and pathogenic microorganisms from the intestinal lumen by blocking their access to epithelial receptors, entrapping them in mucus, and facilitating their removal by peristaltic and mucociliary activities. In addition, SIgA functions in mucosal immunity and intestinal homeostasis through mechanisms that have only recently been revealed. In just the past several years, SIgA has been identified as having the capacity to directly quench bacterial virulence factors, influence composition of the intestinal microbiota by Fab-dependent and Fab-independent mechanisms, promote retro-transport of antigens across the intestinal epithelium to dendritic cell subsets in gut-associated lymphoid tissue, and, finally, to downregulate proinflammatory responses normally associated with the uptake of highly pathogenic bacteria and potentially allergenic antigens. This review summarizes the intrinsic biological activities now associated with SIgA and their relationships with immunity and intestinal homeostasis.},

We directly examined in vitro loop formation mediated by Escherichia coli lactose repressor using single-molecule structural and kinetics methods. Small ( approximately 150 bp) loops form quickly and stably, even with out-of-phase operator spacings. Unexpectedly, repeated spontaneous transitions between two distinct loop structures were observed in individual protein-DNA complexes. The results imply a dynamic equilibrium between a novel loop structure with the repressor in its crystallographic "V" conformation and a second structure with a more extended linear repressor conformation that substantially lessens the DNA bending strain. The ability to switch between different loop structures may help to explain how robust transcription regulation is maintained even though the mechanical work required to form a loop may change substantially with metabolic conditions.},

abstract = {Colonization factor antigens (CFAs) of human enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli can be divided in groups based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of their major subunit protein. One of the groups that has been distinguished in this way, is the CFA/I group of fimbriae. The sequence of the fimbrial subunit genes in the operons encoding the antigens CS4, CS14 and CS17, all members of this group, was determined. A duplication of the fimbrial subunit gene (csuA) was found in the CS14 operon, both genes encoding very similar proteins. Purified CS14 fimbriae consist of two proteins with different molecular masses (15.5 and 17.0 kDa) but identical N-terminal amino acid sequences, which strongly suggests that both csuA genes are transcribed. A phylogenetic tree derived from the amino acid sequences of the CFA/I, CS1, CS2, CS4, CS14, CS17 and CS19 subunit proteins shows that CS1, CS17 and CS19 belong to the same subgroup. CFA/I, CS4 and CS14 belong to a second subgroup, while CS2 is distinct within the CFA/I group of fimbriae. The genetic similarity between CS1, CS17 and CS19 is reflected in the substantial immunological cross-reactivity observed, both between their protein subunits and intact fimbriae.},

abstract = {Receptor-ligand bonds strengthened by tensile mechanical force are referred to as catch bonds. This review examines experimental data and biophysical theory to analyze why mechanical force prolongs the lifetime of these bonds rather than shortens the lifetime by pulling the ligand out of the binding pocket. Although many mathematical models can explain catch bonds, experiments using structural variants have been more helpful in determining how catch bonds work. The underlying mechanism has been worked out so far only for the bacterial adhesive protein FimH. This protein forms catch bonds because it is allosterically activated when mechanical force pulls an inhibitory domain away from the ligand-binding domain. Other catch bond-forming proteins, including blood cell adhesion proteins called selectins and the motor protein myosin, show evidence of allosteric regulation between two domains, but it remains unclear if this is related to their catch bond behavior.},

abstract = {How do molecules interact with each other? What happens if a neurotransmitter binds to a ligand-operated ion channel? How do antibodies recognize their antigens? Molecular recognition events play a pivotal role in nature: in enzymatic catalysis and during the replication and transcription of the genome; it is also important for the cohesion of cellular structures and in numerous metabolic reactions that molecules interact with each other in a specific manner. Conventional methods such as calorimetry provide very precise values of binding enthalpies; these are, however, average values obtained from a large ensemble of molecules without knowledge of the dynamics of the molecular recognition event. Which forces occur when a single molecular couple meets and forms a bond? Since the development of the scanning force microscope and force spectroscopy a couple of years ago, tools have now become available for measuring the forces between interfaces with high precision-starting from colloidal forces to the interaction of single molecules. The manipulation of individual molecules using force spectroscopy is also possible. In this way, the mechanical properties on a molecular scale are measurable. The study of single molecules is not an exclusive domain of force spectroscopy; it can also be performed with a surface force apparatus, laser tweezers, or the micropipette technique. Regardless of these techniques, force spectroscopy has been proven as an extraordinary versatile tool. The intention of this review article is to present a critical evaluation of the actual development of static force spectroscopy. The article mainly focuses on experiments dealing with inter- and intramolecular forces-starting with "simple" electrostatic forces, then ligand-receptor systems, and finally the stretching of individual molecules.},

abstract = {Blocking the primary stages of infection, namely bacterial attachment to host cell receptors and colonization of the mucosal surface, may be the most effective strategy to prevent bacterial infections. Bacterial attachment usually involves an interaction between a bacterial surface protein called an adhesin and the host cell receptor. Recent preclinical vaccine studies with the FimH adhesin (derived from uropathogenic Escherichia coli) have confirmed that antibodies elicited against an adhesin can impede colonization, block infection, and prevent disease. The studies indicate that prophylactic vaccination with adhesins can block bacterial infections. With recent advances in the identification, characterization, and isolation of other adhesins, similar approaches are being explored to prevent infections, from otitis media and dental caries to pneumonia and sepsis.},

abstract = {The physicochemical properties and dynamics of bacterial envelope, play a major role in bacterial activity. In this study, the morphological, nanomechanical and electrohydrodynamic properties of Escherichia coli K-12 mutant cells were thoroughly investigated as a function of bulk medium ionic strength using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and electrokinetics (electrophoresis). Bacteria were differing according to genetic alterations controlling the production of different surface appendages (short and rigid Ag43 adhesins, longer and more flexible type 1 fimbriae and F pilus). From the analysis of the spatially resolved force curves, it is shown that cells elasticity and turgor pressure are not only depending on bulk salt concentration but also on the presence/absence and nature of surface appendage. In 1 mM KNO(3), cells without appendages or cells surrounded by Ag43 exhibit large Young moduli and turgor pressures (∼700-900 kPa and ∼100-300 kPa respectively). Under similar ionic strength condition, a dramatic ∼50{\%} to ∼70{\%} decrease of these nanomechanical parameters was evidenced for cells with appendages. Qualitatively, such dependence of nanomechanical behavior on surface organization remains when increasing medium salt content to 100 mM, even though, quantitatively, differences are marked to a much smaller extent. Additionally, for a given surface appendage, the magnitude of the nanomechanical parameters decreases significantly when increasing bulk salt concentration. This effect is ascribed to a bacterial exoosmotic water loss resulting in a combined contraction of bacterial cytoplasm together with an electrostatically-driven shrinkage of the surface appendages. The former process is demonstrated upon AFM analysis, while the latter, inaccessible upon AFM imaging, is inferred from electrophoretic data interpreted according to advanced soft particle electrokinetic theory. Altogether, AFM and electrokinetic results clearly demonstrate the intimate relationship between structure/flexibility and charge of bacterial envelope and propensity of bacterium and surface appendages to contract under hypertonic conditions.},

abstract = {We used atomic force microscopy to measure the binding forces between Mucin1 (MUC1) peptide and a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody selected from a scFv library screened against MUC1. This binding interaction is central to the design of molecules used for targeted delivery of radioimmunotherapeutic agents for prostate and breast cancer treatment. Our experiments separated the specific binding interaction from nonspecific interactions by tethering the antibody and MUC1 molecules to the atomic force microscope tip and sample surface with flexible polymer spacers. Rupture force magnitude and elastic characteristics of the spacers allowed identification of the rupture events corresponding to different numbers of interacting proteins. We used dynamic force spectroscopy to estimate the intermolecular potential widths and equivalent thermodynamic off rates for monovalent, bivalent, and trivalent interactions. Measured interaction potential parameters agree with the results of molecular docking simulation. Our results demonstrate that an increase of the interaction valency leads to a precipitous decline in the dissociation rate. Binding forces measured for monovalent and multivalent interactions match the predictions of a Markovian model for the strength of multiple uncorrelated bonds in a parallel configuration. Our approach is promising for comparison of the specific effects of molecular modifications as well as for determination of the best configuration of antibody-based multivalent targeting agents.},

Here we present the crystal structure of FimH incorporated into the multiprotein fimbrial tip, where the anchoring (pilin) domain of FimH interacts with the mannose-binding (lectin) domain and causes a twist in the beta sandwich fold of the latter. This loosens the mannose-binding pocket on the opposite end of the lectin domain, resulting in an inactive low-affinity state of the adhesin. The autoinhibition effect of the pilin domain is removed by application of tensile force across the bond, which separates the domains and causes the lectin domain to untwist and clamp tightly around the ligand like a finger-trap toy. Thus, beta sandwich domains, which are common in multidomain proteins exposed to tensile force in vivo, can undergo drastic allosteric changes and be subjected to mechanical regulation.},

abstract = {Many bacterial species possess long filamentous structures known as pili or fimbriae extending from their surfaces. Despite the diversity in pilus structure and biogenesis, pili in Gram-negative bacteria are typically formed by non-covalent homopolymerization of major pilus subunit proteins (pilins), which generates the pilus shaft. Additional pilins may be added to the fiber and often function as host cell adhesins. Some pili are also involved in biofilm formation, phage transduction, DNA uptake and a special form of bacterial cell movement, known as 'twitching motility'. In contrast, the more recently discovered pili in Gram-positive bacteria are formed by covalent polymerization of pilin subunits in a process that requires a dedicated sortase enzyme. Minor pilins are added to the fiber and play a major role in host cell colonization.This review gives an overview of the structure, assembly and function of the best-characterized pili of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.},

These P fimbriae were serotyped with specific monoclonal antibodies. Serum samples from the patients were analyzed for the presence of specific antibodies to the P fimbriae. In all cases antifimbrial antibodies were found, strongly suggesting that these P fimbriae are expressed in vivo.

Tomograms reveal y-shaped IgG molecules with three protruding subunits. Docking X-ray structures enabled us to recognize the three subunits as two ellipsoidal Fab arms and a heart-shaped Fc stem. Each subunit has a similar structure in the tomograms and in the X-ray map. Notably, the positions of the Fab arms relative to the Fc stem differed greatly from one molecule to another. The large flexibility of IgG in solution is most likely of functional significance in antigen recognition. This distribution of individual structures provides a qualitative insight into the system dynamics.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Vaccine development for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is dependent on in-depth understanding of toxin and colonization factor (CF) distribution. We sought to describe ETEC epidemiology across regions and populations, focusing on CF and toxin prevalence. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the published literature, including studies reporting data on ETEC CF and toxin distributions among those with ETEC infection. Point estimates and confidence intervals were calculated using random effects models. RESULTS: Data on 17,205 ETEC isolates were abstracted from 136 included studies. Approximately half of the studies (49{\%}) involved endemic populations, and an additional 17{\%} involved only travel populations. Globally, 60{\%} of isolates expressed LT either alone (27{\%}) or in combination with ST (33{\%}). CFA/I-expressing strains were common in all regions (17{\%}), as were ETEC expressing CFA/II (9{\%}) and IV (18{\%}). Marked variation in toxins and CFs across regions and populations was observed. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate the relative importance of specific CFs in achieving target product profiles for a future ETEC vaccine. However, heterogeneity across time, population, and region, confounded by variability in CF and toxin detection methodologies, obfuscates rational estimates for valency requirements.},

In a similar manner to Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative biofilm formation is fundamentally determined by a series of steps outlined more fully in this review, namely adhesion, cellular aggregation, and the production of an extracellular polymeric matrix. More specifically this review will explore the biosynthesis and role of pili and flagella in Gram-negative adhesion and accumulation on surfaces in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli. The process of biofilm maturation is compared and contrasted in both species, namely the production of the exopolysaccharides via the polysaccharide synthesis locus (Psl), pellicle Formation (Pel) and alginic acid synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and UDP-4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose and colonic acid synthesis in Escherichia coli. An emphasis is placed on the importance of the LuxR homologue sdiA; the luxS/autoinducer-II; an autoinducer-III/epinephrine/norepinephrine and indole mediated Quorum sensing systems in enabling Gram-negative bacteria to adapt to their environments. The majority of Gram-negative biofilms consist of polysaccharides of a simple sugar structure (either homo- or heteropolysaccharides) that provide an optimum environment for the survival and maturation of bacteria, allowing them to display increased resistance to antibiotics and predation.},

abstract = {We focus on the effect of cadence and work rate on energy expenditure and efficiency in cycling, and present arguments to support the contention that gross efficiency can be considered to be the most relevant expression of efficiency. A linear relationship between work rate and energy expenditure appears to be a rather consistent outcome among the various studies considered in this review, irrespective of subject performance level. This relationship is an example of the Fenn effect, described more than 80 years ago for muscle contraction. About 91{\%} of all variance in energy expenditure can be explained by work rate, with only about 10{\%} being explained by cadence. Gross efficiency is strongly dependent on work rate, mainly because of the diminishing effect of the (zero work-rate) base-line energy expenditure with increasing work rate. The finding that elite athletes have a higher gross efficiency than lower-level performers may largely be explained by this phenomenon. However, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the energetically optimal cadence for cycling because of the multiple factors associated with cadence that affect energy expenditure.},

abstract = {Adhesion to host tissues is an initiating step in a majority of bacterial infections. In the case of Gram-negative bacteria this adhesion is often mediated by a specific interaction between an adhesin, positioned at the distal end of bacterial pili, and its receptor on the surface of the host tissue. Furthermore, the rod of the pilus, and particularly its biomechanical properties, is believed to be crucial for the ability of bacteria to withstand external forces caused by, for example, (in the case of urinary tract infections) urinary rinsing flows by redistributing the force to several pili. In this work, the adhesion properties of P-piliated E. coli and their dependence of pH have been investigated in a broad pH range by both the surface plasmon resonance technique and force measuring optical tweezers. We demonstrate that P piliated bacteria have an adhesion ability throughout the entire physiologically relevant pH range (pH 4.5 - 8). We also show that pH has a higher impact on the binding rate than on the binding stability or the biomechanical properties of pili; the binding rate was found to have a maximum around pH 5 while the binding stability was found to have a broader distribution over pH and be significant over the entire physiologically relevant pH range. Force measurements on a single organelle level show that the biomechanical properties of P pili are not significantly affected by pH.},

abstract = {In biology, molecular linkages at, within, and beneath cell interfaces arise mainly from weak noncovalent interactions. These bonds will fail under any level of pulling force if held for sufficient time. Thus, when tested with ultrasensitive force probes, we expect cohesive material strength and strength of adhesion at interfaces to be time- and loading rate-dependent properties. To examine what can be learned from measurements of bond strength, we have extended Kramers' theory for reaction kinetics in liquids to bond dissociation under force and tested the predictions by smart Monte Carlo (Brownian dynamics) simulations of bond rupture. By definition, bond strength is the force that produces the most frequent failure in repeated tests of breakage, i.e., the peak in the distribution of rupture forces. As verified by the simulations, theory shows that bond strength progresses through three dynamic regimes of loading rate. First, bond strength emerges at a critical rate of loading (> or = 0) at which spontaneous dissociation is just frequent enough to keep the distribution peak at zero force. In the slow-loading regime immediately above the critical rate, strength grows as a weak power of loading rate and reflects initial coupling of force to the bonding potential. At higher rates, there is crossover to a fast regime in which strength continues to increase as the logarithm of the loading rate over many decades independent of the type of attraction. Finally, at ultrafast loading rates approaching the domain of molecular dynamics simulations, the bonding potential is quickly overwhelmed by the rapidly increasing force, so that only naked frictional drag on the structure remains to retard separation. Hence, to expose the energy landscape that governs bond strength, molecular adhesion forces must be examined over an enormous span of time scales. However, a significant gap exists between the time domain of force measurements in the laboratory and the extremely fast scale of molecular motions. Using results from a simulation of biotin-avidin bonds (Izrailev, S., S. Stepaniants, M. Balsera, Y. Oono, and K. Schulten. 1997. Molecular dynamics study of unbinding of the avidin-biotin complex. Biophys. J., this issue), we describe how Brownian dynamics can help bridge the gap between molecular dynamics and probe tests.},

abstract = {P fimbria, a mannose-resistant adhesin of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), has been shown to be associated with acute pyelonephritis. The pap gene cluster encodes the proteins required for P-fimbrial biogenesis, including papG, which encodes the tip adhesin. The three most studied PapG molecular variants, which are shown to bind distinct isoreceptors, are PapGI, -II, and -III. PapGII preferentially binds globoside, or GbO4, a glycolipid isoreceptor of the human kidney. Studies using different animal models of ascending urinary tract infection (UTI) have demonstrated a variable role for P fimbriae, and specifically PapGII-mediated adherence, in renal colonization. The disparities in the results obtained from those studies are likely to be attributed to the differences in animal models and UPEC strains utilized. One explanation that is discussed in detail is the contribution of multiple fimbriae of UPEC that potentially mediate adherence to the mammalian kidney. Overall, P fimbriae appear to play some role in mediating adherence to uroepithelial cells in vivo and establishing an inflammatory response during renal colonization, thus contributing to kidney damage during acute pyelonephritis. To verify that P fimbriae contribute to the pathogenesis of UPEC during ascending UTI (and in particular acute pyelonephritis), future studies should be conducted to satisfy fully all three tenets of the molecular Koch's postulates, including complementation of a mutated allele.},

abstract = {This article reviews the mechanisms of bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces, the factors affecting the adhesion, the techniques used in estimating bacteria-material interactions and the models that have been developed in order to predict adhesion. The process of bacterial adhesion includes an initial physicochemical interaction phase and a late molecular and cellular one. It is a complicated process influenced by many factors, including the bacterial properties, the material surface characteristics, the environmental factors, such as the presence of serum proteins and the associated flow conditions. Two categories of techniques used in estimating bacteria-material interactions are described: those that utilize fluid flowing against the adhered bacteria and counting the percentage of bacteria that detach, and those that manipulate single bacteria in various configurations which lend themselves to more specific force application and provide the basis for theoretical analysis of the receptor-ligand interactions. The theories that are reviewed are the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, the thermodynamic approach and the extended DLVO theory. Over the years, significant work has been done to investigate the process of bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces, however a lot of questions still remain unanswered.},

The standard deviation of the location of nominally stationary 50-nm-diameter nanoparticles was found to be about 50nm along the light path and about 5nm in the plane perpendicular to the light path. The method is based on oscillating the microscope objective along the light path using a piezo actuator and acquiring images with the condenser aperture closed to a minimum to enhance the effects of diffraction. Data processing in the time and spatial domains allowed the location of particles to be obtained automatically so that the technique has potential applications both in the processing of nanoparticles and in their use in a variety of fields including nanobiotechnology, pharmaceuticals and food processing where a simple optical microscope maybe preferred for a variety of reasons.},

abstract = {Type 1 fimbriae of enterobacteria are heteropolymeric organelles of adhesion composed of FimH, a mannose-binding lectin, and a shaft composed primarily of FimA. We compared the binding activities of recombinant clones expressing type 1 fimbriae from Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella typhimurium for gut and uroepithelial cells and for various soluble mannosylated proteins. Each fimbria was characterized by its capacity to bind particular epithelial cells and to aggregate mannoproteins. However, when each respective FimH subunit was cloned and expressed in the absence of its shaft as a fusion protein with MalE, each FimH bound a wide range of mannose-containing compounds. In addition, we found that expression of FimH on a heterologous fimbrial shaft, e.g. K. pneumoniae FimH on the E. coli fimbrial shaft or vice versa, altered the binding specificity of FimH such that it closely resembled that of the native heterologous type 1 fimbriae. Furthermore, attachment to and invasion of bladder epithelial cells, which were mediated much better by native E. coli type 1 fimbriae compared with native K. pneumoniae type 1 fimbriae, were found to be dependent on the background of the fimbrial shaft (E. coli versus K. pneumoniae) rather than the background of the FimH expressed. Thus, the distinct binding specificities of different enterobacterial type 1 fimbriae cannot be ascribed solely to the primary structure of their respective FimH subunits, but are also modulated by the fimbrial shaft on which each FimH subunit is presented, possibly through conformational constraints imposed on FimH by the fimbrial shaft. The capacity of type 1 fimbrial shafts to modulate the tissue tropism of different enterobacterial species represents a novel function for these highly organized structures.},

abstract = {Many bacteria and eukaryotic cells express adhesive proteins at the end of tethers that elongate reversibly at constant or near constant force, which we refer to as yielding elasticity. Here we address the function of yielding elastic adhesive tethers with Escherichia coli bacteria as a model for cell adhesion, using a combination of experiments and simulations. The adhesive bond kinetics and tether elasticity was modeled in the simulations with realistic biophysical models that were fit to new and previously published single molecule force spectroscopy data. The simulations were validated by comparison to experiments measuring the adhesive behavior of E. coli in flowing fluid. Analysis of the simulations demonstrated that yielding elasticity is required for the bacteria to remain bound in high and variable flow conditions, because it allows the force to be distributed evenly between multiple bonds. In contrast, strain-hardening and linear elastic tethers concentrate force on the most vulnerable bonds, which leads to failure of the entire adhesive contact. Load distribution is especially important to noncovalent receptor-ligand bonds, because they become exponentially shorter lived at higher force above a critical force, even if they form catch bonds. The advantage of yielding is likely to extend to any blood cells or pathogens adhering in flow, or to any situation where bonds are stretched unequally due to surface roughness, unequal native bond lengths, or conditions that act to unzip the bonds.},

Other extensions include Multalign Viewer, for showing multiple sequence alignments and associated structures; ViewDock, for screening docked ligand orientations; Movie, for replaying molecular dynamics trajectories; and Volume Viewer, for display and analysis of volumetric data. A discussion of the usage of Chimera in real-world situations is given, along with anticipated future directions. Chimera includes full user documentation, is free to academic and nonprofit users, and is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux, Apple Mac OS X, SGI IRIX, and HP Tru64 Unix from http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/.},

abstract = {Selectin-mediated leukocyte rolling is crucial for the proper function of the immune response. Recently, selectin-mediated rolling was recreated in a cell-free system (Biophysical Journal 71:2902-2907 (1996)); it was shown that sialyl Lewis(x) (sLe(x))-coated microspheres roll over E-selectin-coated surfaces under hydrodynamic flow. The cell-free system removes many confounding cellular features, such as cell deformability and signaling, allowing us to focus on the role of carbohydrate/selectin physical chemistry in mediating rolling. In this paper, we use adhesive dynamics, a computational method that allows us to simulate adhesion, to analyze the experimental data produced in the cell-free system. We simulate the effects of shear rate, ligand density, and number of receptors per particle on rolling velocity and compare them with experimental results obtained with the cell-free system. If we assume the population of particles is homogeneous in receptor density, we predict that particle rolling velocity calculated in simulations is more sensitive to shear rate than found in experiments. Also, the calculated rolling velocity is more sensitive to the number of receptors on the microspheres than to the ligand density on the surface, again in contrast to experiment. We argue that heterogeneity in the distribution of receptors throughout the particle population causes these discrepancies. We improve the agreement between experiment and simulation by calculating the average rolling velocity of a population whose receptors follow a normal distribution, suggesting heterogeneity among particles significantly affects the experimental results. Further comparison between theory and experiment yields an estimate of the reactive compliance of sLe(x)/E-selectin interactions of 0.25 A, close to that reported in the literature for E-selectin and its natural ligand (0.3 A). We also provide an estimate of the value of the intrinsic association rate (between 10(4) and 10(5) s(-1)) for the formation of sLe(x)/E-selectin bonds.},

abstract = {In view of the relentless increase in antibiotic resistance in human pathogens, efforts are needed to safeguard our future therapeutic options against infectious diseases. In addition to regulatory changes in our antibiotic use, this will have to include the development of new therapeutic compounds. One area that has received growing attention in recent years is the possibility to treat or prevent infections by targeting the virulence mechanisms that render bacteria pathogenic. Antivirulence targets include bacterial adherence, secretion of toxic effector molecules, bacterial persistence through biofilm formation, quorum sensing and immune evasion. Effective small-molecule compounds have already been identified that suppress such processes. In this review, we discuss the susceptibility of such compounds to the development of resistance, by comparison with known resistance mechanisms observed for classical bacteriostatic or bacteriolytic antibiotics, and by review of available experimental case studies. Unfortunately, appearance of resistance mechanisms has already been demonstrated for some, showing that the quest of new, lasting drugs remains complicated.},

@article{King2005,
abstract = {Transient capture of cells or model microspheres from flow over substrates sparsely coated with adhesive ligands has provided significant insight into the unbinding kinetics of leukocyte:endothelium adhesion complexes under external force. Whenever a cell is stopped by a point attachment, the full hydrodynamic load is applied to the adhesion site within an exceptionally short time-less than the reciprocal of the hydrodynamic shear rate (e.g., typically <0.01 s). The decay in numbers of cells or beads that remain attached to a surface has been used as a measure of the kinetics of molecular bond dissociation under constant force, revealing a modest increase in detachment rate at growing applied shear stresses. On the other hand, when detached under steady ramps of force with mechanical probes (e.g., the atomic force microscope and biomembrane force probe), P-selectin:PSGL-1 adhesion bonds break at rates that increase enormously under rising force, yielding 100-fold faster off rates at force levels comparable to high shear. The comparatively weak effect of force on tether survival in flow chamber experiments could be explained by a possible partition of the load amongst several bonds. However, a comprehensive understanding of the difference in kinetic behavior requires us to also inspect other factors affecting the dynamics of attachment-force buildup, such as the interfacial compliance of all linkages supporting the adhesion complex. Here, combining the mechanical properties of the leukocyte interface measured in probe tests with single-bond kinetics and the kinetics of cytoskeletal dissociation, we show that for the leukocyte adhesion complex P-selectin:PSGL-1, a detailed adhesive dynamics simulation accurately reproduces the tethering behavior of cells observed in flow chambers. Surprisingly, a mixture of 10{\%} single bonds and 90{\%} dimeric bonds is sufficient to fully match the data of the P-selectin:PSGL-1 experiments, with the calculated decay in fraction of attached cells still appearing exponential.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few prospective studies have examined the impact of both green tea and coffee consumption on strokes. We investigated the association of the combination of those consumption with stroke incidence in a general population. METHODS: We studied 82 369 Japanese (aged 45-74 years; without cardiovascular disease [CVD] or cancer in 1995 and 1998 for Cohort I and II, respectively) who received 13 years of mean follow-up through the end of 2007. Green tea and coffee consumption was assessed by self-administered food frequency questionnaire at baseline. RESULTS: In the 1 066 718 person-years of follow-up, we documented the incidence of strokes (n=3425) and coronary heart disease (n=910). Compared with seldom drinking green tea, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95{\%} confidence intervals) of all strokes were 0.86 (0.78-0.95) and 0.80 (0.73-0.89) in green tea 2 to 3 and ≥ 4 cups/d, respectively. Higher green tea consumption was associated with inverse risks of CVD and strokes subtypes. Compared with seldom drinking coffee, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95{\%} confidence intervals) of all strokes were 0.89 (0.80-0.99), 0.80 (0.72-0.90), and 0.81 (0.72-0.91) for coffee 3 to 6 times/week and 1 and ≥ 2 times/day, respectively. Coffee consumption was associated with an inverse risk of CVD and cerebral infarction. Higher green tea or coffee consumption reduced the risks of CVD and stroke subtypes (especially in intracerebral hemorrhage, P for interaction between green tea and coffee=0.04). None of the significant association was observed in coronary heart disease. CONCLUSIONS: Higher green tea and coffee consumption were inversely associated with risk of CVD and stroke in general population.},

abstract = {Microfluidic channels coated with ligands are a versatile platform for the separation or enrichment of cells from small sample volumes. This adhesion-based mode of separation is mediated by ligand-receptor bonds between the cells and channel surface and also by fluid shear stress. This paper demonstrates how aspects of microchannel geometry can play an additional role in controlling cell adhesion. With a combination of computational fluid dynamics modeling and cell adhesion experiments, channels with sharp turns are shown to have regions with near-zero velocity at the turn regions where large numbers of cells adhere or become collected. The lack of uniform adhesion in the turn regions compared to other regions of these channels, together with the large variability in observed cell adhesion indicates that channels with sharp turns are not optimal for cell-capture applications where predictable cell adhesion is desired. Channels with curved turns, on the other hand are shown to provide more uniform and predictable cell adhesion provided the gap between parallel arms of the channels is sufficiently wide. The magnitude of cell adhesion in these curved channels is comparable to that in straight channels with no turns.},

abstract = {To determine how distant sites on supercoiled DNA communicate with each other, the mechanism of site-specific recombination by resolvase was analysed by using a rapid-reaction quench-flow device to study the kinetics of individual steps in the reaction pathway. Three sets of measurements revealed the rates for: (1) the initial binding of the protein to its target sites on the DNA; (2) the synapsis of the two DNA-protein complexes; (3) the overall process of recombination. The binding of the protein to the DNA was complete within 50 milliseconds while recombination required 500 seconds. Surprisingly, synapsis spanned this entire time range: some DNA molecules gave synaptic complexes within ten milliseconds after the initial binding, while others took over 100 seconds. The departure from exponential behaviour may be due to each molecule of DNA having to undergo different conformational fluctuations in order to juxtapose the recombinational sites. From polymer physics theory, the rate of synapsis ought to vary with either the size of the DNA molecule or the length of DNA between the recombinational sites, depending on the nature of the fluctuations, but plasmids of different sizes and with different spacings between the sites all gave the same rates for synapsis. This observation cannot be reconciled with current models for encounters of distant sites on supercoiled DNA. However, the superhelical axis in the DNA molecules used here will be branched at one or more positions and the encounters may arise from the motion of a single branch relative to the remainder of the chain. Alternatively, the non-exponential kinetics for synapsis may be due to multiple re-arrangements of non-productive complexes following DNA juxtaposition.},

abstract = {Using optical tweezers and single particle tracking, we have revealed the motion of a single protein, the lambda-receptor, in the outer membrane of living Escherichia coli bacteria. We genetically modified the lambda-receptor placing a biotin on an extracellular site of the receptor in vivo. The efficiency of this in vivo biotinylation is very low, thus enabling the attachment of a streptavidin-coated bead binding specifically to a single biotinylated lambda-receptor. The bead was used as a handle for the optical tweezers and as a marker for the single particle tracking routine. We propose a model that allows extraction of the motion of the protein from measurements of the mobility of the bead-molecule complex; these results are equally applicable to analyze bead-protein complexes in other membrane systems. Within a domain of radius approximately 25 nm, the receptor diffuses with a diffusion constant of (1.5 +/- 1.0) x 10(-9) cm(2)/s and sits in a harmonic potential as if it were tethered by an elastic spring of spring constant of {\~{}}1.0 x 10(-2) pN/nm to the bacterial membrane.

We consider a bond with a structured energy landscape which is modeled by a network of force dependent transition rates between intermediate states. The behavior of a model with only one intermediate state and a model describing a molecular zipper is studied. We calculate the bond lifetime as a function of an applied force and unbinding forces under an increasing applied load and determine the relationship between both quantities. The dissociation via an intermediate state can lead to distinct functional relations of the bond lifetime on force. One possibility is the occurrence of three force regimes where the lifetime of the bond is determined by different transitions within the energy landscape. This case can be related to recent experimental observations of the force-induced dissociation of single avidin-biotin bonds.},

abstract = {Metal oxides can increase the adhesion of negatively-charged bacteria to surfaces primarily due to their positive charge. However, the hydrophobicity of a metal-oxide surface can also increase adhesion of bacteria. In order to understand the relative contribution of charge and hydrophobicity to bacterial adhesion, we measured the adhesion of 8 strains of bacteria, under conditions of low and high-ionic strength (1 and 100 mM, respectively) to 11 different surfaces and examined adhesion as a function of charge, hydrophobicity (water contact angle) and surface energy. Inorganic surfaces included three uncoated glass surfaces and eight metal-oxide thin films prepared on the upper (non-tin-exposed) side of float glass by chemical vapor deposition. The Gram-negative bacteria differed in lengths of lipopolysaccharides on their outer surface (three Escherichia coli strains), the amounts of exopolysaccharides (two Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains), and their known relative adhesion to sand grains (two Burkholderia cepacia strains). One Gram positive bacterium was also used that had a lower adhesion to glass than these other bacteria (Bacillus subtilis). For all eight bacteria, there was a consistent increase in adhesion between with the type of inorganic surface in the order: float glass exposed to tin (coded here as Si-Sn), glass microscope slide (Si-m), uncoated air-side float glass surface (Si-a), followed by thin films of (Co(1-y-z)Fe(y)Cr(z))3O4, Ti/Fe/O, TiO2, SnO2, SnO2:F, SnO2:Sb, A1(2)O3, and Fe2O3 (the colon indicates metal doping, a slash indicates that the metal is a major component, while the dash is used to distinguish surfaces). Increasing the ionic strength from 1 to 100 mM increased adhesion by a factor of 2.0 +/- 0.6 (73{\%} of the sample results were within the 95{\%} CI) showing electrostatic charge was important in adhesion. However, adhesion was not significantly correlated with bacterial charge and contact angle. Adhesion (A) of the eight strains was significantly (P < 10(-25)) correlated with total adhesion free energy (U) between the bacteria and surface (A = 2162e(-1.8U)). Although the correlation was significant, agreement between the model and data was poor for the low energy surfaces (R2 = 0.68), indicating that better models or additional methods to characterize bacteria and surfaces are still needed to more accurately describe initial bacterial adhesion to inorganic surfaces.},

CI regulates its own synthesis in a lysogen by activating and repressing its promoter, P(RM). CI participates in long-range interactions involving two regions of widely separated operator sites by generating a loop in the intervening DNA. We investigated the roles of each individual site under conditions that permitted DNA loop formation by using in vitro transcription assays for the first time on supercoiled DNA that mimics in vivo situation. We confirmed that DNA loops generated by oligomerization of CI bound to its operators influence the autoactivation and autorepression of P(RM) regulation. We additionally report that different configurations of DNA loops are central to this regulation--one configuration further enhances autoactivation and another is essential for autorepression of P(RM).},

abstract = {Force measurements are performed on single DNA molecules with an optical trapping interferometer that combines subpiconewton force resolution and millisecond time resolution. A molecular construction is prepared for mechanically unzipping several thousand-basepair DNA sequences in an in vitro configuration. The force signals corresponding to opening and closing the double helix at low velocity are studied experimentally and are compared to calculations assuming thermal equilibrium. We address the effect of the stiffness on the basepair sensitivity and consider fluctuations in the force signal. With respect to earlier work performed with soft microneedles, we obtain a very significant increase in basepair sensitivity: presently, sequence features appearing at a scale of 10 basepairs are observed. When measured with the optical trap the unzipping force exhibits characteristic flips between different values at specific positions that are determined by the base sequence. This behavior is attributed to bistabilities in the position of the opening fork; the force flips directly reflect transitions between different states involved in the time-averaging of the molecular system.},

abstract = {Particle transfer in the wall region of turbulent boundary layers is dominated by the coherent structures which control the turbulence regeneration cycle. Coherent structures bring particles toward and away from the wall and favour particle segregation in the viscous region, giving rise to non-uniform particle. distribution profiles which peak close to the wall. The object of this work is to understand the reasons for higher particle concentration in the wall region by examining turbulent transfer of heavy particles to and away from the wall in connection with the coherent structures of the boundary layer. We will examine the behaviour of a dilute dispersion of heavy particles - flyashes in air - in a vertical channel flow, using pseudo-spectral direct numerical simulation to calculate the turbulent flow field at a shear Reynolds number Re-tau = 150, and Lagrangian tracking to describe the dynamics of particles. Drag force, gravity and Saffman lift are used in the equation of motion for the particles, which are assumed to have no influence on the flow field. Particle interaction with the wall is fully elastic. As reported in several previous investigations, we found that particles are transferred by sweeps - Q2 type events - in the wall region, where they preferentially accumulate in the low-speed streak environments, whereas ejections - Q4 type events - transfer particles from the wall region to the outer flow. We quantify the efficiency of the instantaneous realizations of the Reynolds stresses events in transferring different size particles to the wall and away from the wall, respectively. Our findings confirm that sweeps and ejections are efficient transfer mechanisms for particles. In particular, we find that only those sweep and ejection events with substantial spatial coherence are effective in transferring particles. However, the efficiency of the transfer mechanisms is conditioned by the presence of particles to be transferred. In the case of ejections, particles are more rarely available since, when in the viscous wall layer, they are concentrated under the low-speed streaks. Even though the low-speed streaks are ejection-like environments, particles remain trapped for a long time. This phenomenon, which causes accumulation of particles in the near-wall region, can be interpreted in terms of overall fluxes toward and away from the wall by the theory of turbophoresis. This theory, proposed initially by Caporaloni et al. (1975) and re-examined later by Reeks (1983), can help to explain the existence of net particle fluxes toward the wall as a manifestation of the skewness in the velocity distribution of the particles (Reeks 1983). To understand the local and instantaneous mechanisms which give rise to the phenomenon of turbophoresis, we focus on the near-wall region of the turbulent boundary layer. We examine the role of the rear-end of a quasistreamwise vortex very near to the wall in preventing particles in the proximity of the wall from being re-entrained by the pumping action of the large, farther from the wall, forward-end of a following quasi-streamwise vortex. We examine several mechanisms for turbulence structures near the wall and we find that the mechanism based on the archetypal quasi-streamwise structures identified by Schoppa {\&} Hussain (1997), the parent-offspring regeneration cycle for near-wall quasi-streamwise vortices discussed by Brooke {\&} Hanratty (1993), and the mechanism based on coherent packets of hairpin vortices, the fundamental super-structure characterized by Adrian, Meinhart {\&} Tomkins (2000), all depict the same characteristic pattern whic},

abstract = {Escherichia coli exhibit both shear-stabilized rolling and a transition to stationary adhesion while adhering in fluid flow. Understanding the mechanism by which this shear-enhanced adhesion occurs is an important step in understanding bacterial pathogenesis. In this work, simulations are used to investigate the relative contributions of fimbrial deformation and bond transitions to the rolling and stationary adhesion of E. coli. Each E. coli body is surrounded by many long, thin fimbriae terminating in a single FimH receptor that is capable of forming a catch bond with mannose. As simulated cells progress along a mannosylated surface under flow, the fimbriae bend and buckle as they interact with the surface, and FimH-mannose bonds form and break according to a two-state, allosteric catch-bond model. In simulations, shear-stabilized rolling resulted from an increase in the low-affinity bond number due to increased fimbrial deformation with shear. Catch-bond formation did not occur during cell rolling, but instead led to the transition to stationary adhesion. In contrast, in leukocyte and platelet systems, catch bonds appear to be involved in the stabilization of rolling, and integrin activation is required for stationary adhesion.},

The rupture force of the streptavidin-biotin bond increased more than 2-fold over a range of loading rates between 100 and 5000 pN/s. Moreover, the force measurements showed two regimes of loading in the streptavidin-biotin force spectrum, revealing the presence of two activation barriers in the unbinding process. Parallel experiments carried out with a streptavidin mutant (W120F) were used to investigate the molecular determinants of the activation barriers. From these experiments, we attributed the outer activation barrier in the energy landscape to the molecular interaction of the '3-4' loop of streptavidin that closes behind biotin.},

We investigated the relationship between the polysaccharide portion of LPS and biofilm formation using a series of Escherichia coli mutants defective in genes earlier shown to affect the LPS sugar compositions. Biofilm formation by a deep rough LPS mutant, the hldE strain, was strongly enhanced in comparison with the parental strain and other LPS mutants. The hldE strain also showed a phenotype of increased auto-aggregation and stronger cell surface hydrophobicity compared to the wild-type. Similar results were obtained with another deep rough LPS mutant, the waaC strain whose LPS showed same molecular mass as that of the hldE strain. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) analysis and biofilm formation assay using DNase I revealed that biofilm formation by the hldE strain was dependent on extracellular DNA. Furthermore, a loss of flagella and an increase in amount of outer membrane vesicles in case of the hldE strain were also observed by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, respectively. In addition, we demonstrated that a mutation in the hldE locus, which alters the LPS structure, caused changes in both expression and properties of several surface bacterial factors involved in biofilm formation and virulence. We suggest that the implication of these results should be considered in the context of biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces, which is frequently associated with nosocominal infections such as the catheter-associated infections.},

For both DNA molecules, Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations were also performed, using a previously described model. A Fourier mode decomposition procedure was used to compute theoretical light scattering autocorrelation functions (ACFs) from the BD trajectories. Both measured and computed autocorrelation functions were then subjected to the same multiexponential decomposition procedure. Simulated and measured relaxation times as a function of scattering angle were in very good agreement. Similarly, computed and measured static structure factors and radii of gyration agreed within experimental error. One main result of this study is that the amplitudes of the fast-relaxing component in the ACF show a peak at 1 M salt concentration. This nonmonotonic behavior might be caused by an initial increase in the amplitudes of internal motions due to diminishing long-range electrostatic repulsions, followed by a decrease at higher salt concentration due to a compaction of the structure.},

abstract = {Biopolymers are vital structures for many living organisms; for a variety of bacteria, adhesion polymers play a crucial role for the initiation of colonization. Some bacteria express, on their surface, attachment organelles (pili) that comprise subunits formed into stiff helix-like structures that possess unique biomechanical properties. These helix-like structures possess a high degree of flexibility that gives the biopolymers a unique extendibility. This has been considered beneficial for piliated bacteria adhering to host surfaces in the presence of a fluid flow. We show in this work that helix-like pili have the ability to act as efficient dampers of force that can, for a limited time, lower the load on the force-mediating adhesin-receptor bond on the tip of an individual pilus. The model presented is applied to bacteria adhering with a single pilus of either of the two most common types expressed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, P or type 1 pili, subjected to realistic flows. The results indicate that for moderate flows ({\~{}}25 mm/s) the force experienced by the adhesin-receptor interaction at the tip of the pilus can be reduced by a factor of {\~{}}6 and {\~{}}4, respectively. The uncoiling ability provides a bacterium with a "go with the flow" possibility that acts as a damping. It is surmised that this can be an important factor for the initial part of the adhesion process, in particular in turbulent flows, and thereby be of use for bacteria in their striving to survive a natural defense such as fluid rinsing actions.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli colonizes the human intestine shortly after birth, with most strains engaging in a commensal relationship. However, some E. coli strains have evolved toward acquiring genetic traits associated with virulence. Currently, five categories of enteroadherent E. coli strains are well-recognized, and are classified in regard to expressed adhesins and the strategy used during the colonization. The high morbidity associated with diarrhea has motivated investigations focusing on E. coli adhesins, as well on factors that inhibit bacterial adherence. Breastfeeding has proved to be the most effective strategy for preventing diarrhea in children. Aside from the immunoglobulin content, glycocompounds and oligosaccharides in breast milk play a critical role in the innate immunity against diarrheagenic E. coli strains. This review summarizes the colonization factors and virulence strategies exploited by diarrheagenic E. coli strains, addressing the inhibitory effects that oligosaccharides and glycocompounds, such as lactoferrin and free secretory components, exert on the adherence and virulence of these strains. This review thus provides an overview of experimental data indicating that human milk glycocompounds are responsible for the universal protective effect of breastfeeding against diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes.},

abstract = {Adhesion and subsequent aggregation between neutrophils and platelets is dependent upon the initial binding of P-selectin on activated platelets to P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) on the microvilli of neutrophils. High speed, high resolution videomicroscopy of flowing neutrophils interacting with spread platelets demonstrated that thin membrane tethers were pulled from neutrophils in 32 +/- 4{\%} of the interactions. After capture by spread platelets, neutrophil membrane tethers (length of 5.9 +/- 4.1 microm, n = 63) were pulled at an average rate of 6-40 microm/s as the wall shear rate was increased from 100-250 s(-1). The average tether lifetime decreased significantly (P < 0.001) from 630 to 133 ms as the shear rate was increased from 100 s(-1) (F(bond) = 86 pN) to 250 s(-1) (F(bond) = 172 pN), which is consistent with P-selectin/PSGL-1 bond dynamics under stress. Tether formation was blocked by antibodies against P-selectin or PSGL-1, but not by anti-CD18 antibodies. During neutrophil rolling on P-selectin at 150 s(-1), thin membrane tethers were also pulled from the neutrophils. The characteristic jerking motion of the neutrophil coexisted with tether growth (8.9 +/- 8.8 microm long), whereas tether breakage (average lifetime of 3.79 +/- 3.32 s) caused an acute jump in the rolling velocity, proving multiple bonding in the cell surface and the tether surface contact area. Extremely long membrane tethers (>40 microm) were sometimes pulled, which detached in a flow-dependent mechanism of microparticle formation. Membrane tethers were also formed when neutrophils were perfused over platelet monolayers. These results are the first visualization of the often hypothesized tethers that shield the P-selectin/PSGL-1 bond from force loading to regulate neutrophil rolling during inflammation and thrombosis.},

Genetic fingerprint analyses based on repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR) showed that 9 of 10 such CF-negative isolates which produced the thermolabile and the porcine thermostabile enterotoxin could be divided into three clusters. Following transformation with a plasmid harbouring the gene encoding CfaR, a positive regulator for several ETEC adhesins, three of the six strains in the first cluster expressed coli surface antigen 20 (CS20). No CFs were identified on the two transformed strains in the second cluster while the transformants of the two strains in the last cluster expressed CS12, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of which was deciphered. The study illustrates the potential of using genetic fingerprinting to group ETEC into clusters of strains with genes encoding different CFs and confirms the ability of CfaR to induce the expression of several different CFs.},

abstract = {Diarrhea is the second leading cause of death in children younger than 5 years and continues to be a major threat to global health. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are the most common bacteria causing diarrhea in developing countries. ETEC strains are able to attach to host small intestinal epithelial cells by using bacterial colonization factor antigen (CFA) adhesins. This attachment helps to initiate the diarrheal disease. Vaccines that induce antiadhesin immunity to block adherence of ETEC strains that express immunologically heterogeneous CFA adhesins are expected to protect against ETEC diarrhea. In this study, we created a CFA multiepitope fusion antigen (MEFA) carrying representative epitopes of CFA/I, CFA/II (CS1, CS2, and CS3), and CFA/IV (CS4, CS5, and CS6), examined its immunogenicity in mice, and assessed the potential of this MEFA as an antiadhesin vaccine against ETEC. Mice intraperitoneally immunized with this CFA MEFA exhibited no adverse effects and developed immune responses to CFA/I, CFA/II, and CFA/IV adhesins. Moreover, after incubation with serum of the immunized mice, ETEC or E. coli strains expressing CFA/I, CFA/II, or CFA/IV adhesins were significantly inhibited in adherence to Caco-2 cells. Our results indicated this CFA MEFA elicited antibodies that not only cross-reacted to CFA/I, CFA/II and CFA/IV adhesins but also broadly inhibited adherence of E. coli strains expressing these seven adhesins and suggested that this CFA MEFA could be a candidate to induce broad-spectrum antiadhesin protection against ETEC diarrhea. Additionally, this antigen construction approach (creating an MEFA) may be generally used in vaccine development against heterogenic pathogens.},

abstract = {High-resolution structures of macromolecular complexes offer unparalleled insight into the workings of biological systems and hence the interplay of these systems in health and disease. We have adopted a multifaceted approach to understanding the pathogenically important structure of P-pili, the class I adhesion pili from pyelonephritic Escherichia coli. Our approach combines electron cryomicroscopy, site-directed mutagenesis, homology modeling, and energy calculations, resulting in a high-resolution model of PapA, the major structural element of these pili. Fitting of the modeled PapA subunit into the electron cryomicroscopy data provides a detailed view of these pilins within the supramolecular architecture of the pilus filament. A structural hinge in the N-terminal region of the subunit is located at the site of a newly resolved electron density that protrudes from the P-pilus surface. The structural flexibility provided by this hinge is necessary for assembly of P-pili, illustrating one solution to construction of large macromolecular complexes from small repeating units. These data support our hypothesis that domain-swapped pilin subunits transit the outer cell membrane vertically and rotate about the hinge for final positioning into the pilus filament. Our data confirm and supply a structural basis for much previous genetic, biochemical, and structural data. This model of the P-pilus filament provides an insight into the mechanism of assembly of a macromolecular complex essential for initiation of kidney infection by these bacteria.},

@article{Silverblatt1983,
abstract = {Since Duguid and Guilles first described the ability of piliated bacteria to bind to leukocytes, much has been learned about the nature of this interaction. Mannose-sensitive (MS) pili bind to specific mannose-containing receptors on the leukocyte surface. While MS pili are responsible for attachment, the relative hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface determines whether the organism is internalized. Both binding and ingestion trigger the leukocyte to respond with degranulation and enhanced oxidative activity. The response to piliated bacteria, however, is delayed as compared to bacteria opsonized with serum, which may account for the reduced bactericidal activity associated with pili-mediated phagocytosis. A number of factors appear to influence the significance of pili-mediated phagocytosis in vivo. These include natural selective pressures in the host tissue, the ability of the organism to undergo pili phase transition and the presence of serum or other host opsonic factors. Antipili antibody does not enhance leukocyte killing of MS + Escherichia coli, but does stimulate leukocyte metabolic activity. Antipili antibody may, therefore, have an adverse effect on the infectious process by promoting the extracellular release of inflammatory material from the granulocyte.},

To date, there are no drugs that specifically target bacteria in biofilms; however, several approaches are in early-stage development. Here, we review current insights into biofilm physiology and pathology, and discuss how a deep insight into the physical and biological characteristics of biofilms can inform therapeutic strategies and molecular targets for the development of anti-biofilm drugs.},

@article{Bjornham2009a,
abstract = {A number of biomechanical properties of various types of pili expressed by Escherichia coli, predominantly their force-versus-elongation behavior, have previously been assessed in detail on a single pilus level. In vivo, however, bacteria bind in general to host cells by a multitude of pili, which presumably provides them with adhesion properties that differs from those of single pili. Based upon the previously assessed biomechanical properties of individual pili, this work presents a theoretical analysis of the adhesion properties of multipili-attaching bacteria expressing helixlike pili exposed to an external force. Expressions for the adhesion lifetime of dual- and multipili-attaching bacteria are derived and their validity is verified by Monte Carlo simulations. It is demonstrated that the adhesion lifetime of a multipili-binding bacterium depends to a large degree on the cooperativity of the attaching pili, which, in turn, depends strongly on their internal biomechanical properties, in particular their helixlike structure and its ability to elongate, which, in turn, depends on the intrinsic properties of the bonds, e.g., their lengths and activation energies. It is shown, for example, that a decrease in the length of a layer-to-layer bond in the rod of P pili, expressed by E. coli, by 50{\%} leads to a decrease in the adhesion lifetime of a bacterium attaching by ten pili and exposed to a force of 500 pN by three orders of magnitude. The results indicate moreover that the intrinsic properties of the rod for this particular type of pili are optimized for multipili attachment under a broad range of external forces and presumably also to its in vivo environment. For example, P pili seems to be optimized to withstand a force exposure during approximately 3 s, which correspond to the time it takes for a bolus to pass a bacterium attached to the ureteral wall. Even though the results presented in this work apply quantitatively to one type of pilus, they are assumed to apply qualitatively to all helixlike pili systems expressing slip bonds.},

abstract = {Although bacterial pili are known to mediate cell adhesion to a variety of substrates, the molecular interactions behind this process are poorly understood. We report the direct measurement of the forces guiding pili-mediated adhesion, focusing on the medically important probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). Using non-invasive single-cell force spectroscopy (SCFS), we quantify the adhesion forces between individual bacteria and biotic (mucin, intestinal cells) or abiotic (hydrophobic monolayers) surfaces. On hydrophobic surfaces, bacterial pili strengthen adhesion through remarkable nanospring properties, which - presumably - enable the bacteria to resist high shear forces under physiological conditions. On mucin, nanosprings are more frequent and adhesion forces larger, reflecting the influence of specific pili-mucin bonds. Interestingly, these mechanical responses are no longer observed on human intestinal Caco-2 cells. Rather, force curves exhibit constant force plateaus with extended ruptures reflecting the extraction of membrane nanotethers. These single-cell analyses provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which piliated bacteria colonize surfaces (nanosprings, nanotethers), and offer exciting avenues in nanomedicine for understanding and controlling the adhesion of microbial cells (probiotics, pathogens).},

abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a bacterial pathogen that causes diarrhea in children and travelers in developing countries. ETEC adheres to host epithelial cells in the small intestine via a variety of different pili. The CS1 pilus is a prototype for a family of related pili, including the CFA/I pili, present on ETEC and other Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. These pili are assembled by an outer membrane usher protein that catalyzes subunit polymerization via donor strand complementation, in which the N terminus of each incoming pilin subunit fits into a hydrophobic groove in the terminal subunit, completing a $\beta$-sheet in the Ig fold. Here we determined a crystal structure of the CS1 major pilin subunit, CooA, to a 1.6-{\AA} resolution. CooA is a globular protein with an Ig fold and is similar in structure to the CFA/I major pilin CfaB. We determined three distinct negative-stain electron microscopic reconstructions of the CS1 pilus and generated pseudoatomic-resolution pilus structures using the CooA crystal structure. CS1 pili adopt multiple structural states with differences in subunit orientations and packing. We propose that the structural perturbations are accommodated by flexibility in the N-terminal donor strand of CooA and by plasticity in interactions between exposed flexible loops on adjacent subunits. Our results suggest that CS1 and other pili of this class are extensible filaments that can be stretched in response to mechanical stress encountered during colonization.},

abstract = {Fibronectin (Fn) is an important mediator of bacterial invasions and of persistent infections like that of Staphylococcus epidermis. Similar to many other types of cell-protein adhesion, the binding between Fn and S. epidermidis takes place under physiological shear rates. We investigated the dynamics of the interaction between individual living S. epidermidis cells and single Fn molecules under mechanical force by using the scanning force microscope. The mechanical strength of this interaction and the binding site in the Fn molecule were determined. The energy landscape of the binding/unbinding process was mapped, and the force spectrum and the association and dissociation rate constants of the binding pair were measured. The interaction between S. epidermidis cells and Fn molecules is compared with those of two other protein/ligand pairs known to mediate different dynamic states of adhesion of cells under a hydrodynamic flow: the firm adhesion mediated by biotin/avidin interactions, and the rolling adhesion, mediated by L-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 interactions. The inner barrier in the energy landscape of the Fn case characterizes a high-energy binding mode that can sustain larger deformations and for significantly longer times than the correspondent high-strength L-selectin/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 binding mode. The association kinetics of the former interaction is much slower to settle than the latter. On this basis, the observations made at the macroscopic scale by other authors of a strong lability of the bacterial adhesions mediated by Fn under high turbulent flow are rationalized at the molecular level.},

Here, we sought to localize the functionally important domain(s) within the FimH molecule and to determine if antibodies against this domain would block adherence of type 1-fimbriated E. coli to the bladder mucosa in situ and in vivo in an established mouse model of cystitis. We generated translational fusion proteins of disparate regions of the FimH molecule with an affinity tag MalE, and tested each of the fusion products in vitro for functional activity. The minimum region responsible for binding mouse bladder epithelial cells and a soluble mannoprotein, horseradish peroxidase, was contained within residues 1-100 of the FimH molecule. We validated and extended these findings by demonstrating that antibodies directed at the putative binding region of FimH or at synthetic peptides corresponding to epitopes within the binding domain could specifically block type 1 fimbriae-mediated bacterial adherence to bladder epithelial cells in situ and yeast cells in vitro. Next, we compared the ability of mice passively immunized intraperitoneally with antisera raised against residues 1-25 and 253-264 of FimH or 1-13 of FimA to resist bladder colonization in vivo after intravesicular challenge with type 1-fimbriated E. coli. Only the antibody directed at the putative binding region of FimH (anti- s-FimH1-25) significantly reduced E. coli bladder infections in the experimental mouse model of urinary tract infections. Similar results were obtained when the mice were actively immunized with synthetic peptides corresponding to residues 1-25 and 253-264 of FimH or 1-13 of FimA. The mechanism of protection was attributed, at least in part, to inhibition of bacterial adherence to the bladder surface by s-FimH1-25-specific antibody molecules that had filtered through the kidneys into the urine. The level of FimH antibodies entering the bladder from the circulatory system of the immunized mice was found to be markedly enhanced upon bacterial challenge. The potential broad spectrum activity of the protective FimH antibody was indicated from its serologic cross-reactivity with various urinary tract bacterial isolates bearing type 1 fimbriae. These findings could be relevant in the design of an efficacious and broadly reactive FimH vaccine against urinary tract infections.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that bacteria are washed off surfaces as fluid flow increases because they adhere through 'slip-bonds' that weaken under mechanical force. However, we show here that the opposite is true for Escherichia coli attachment to monomannose-coated surfaces via the type 1 fimbrial adhesive subunit, FimH. Raising the shear stress (within the physiologically relevant range) increased accumulation of type 1 fimbriated bacteria on monomannose surfaces by up to two orders of magnitude, and reducing the shear stress caused them to detach. In contrast, bacterial binding to anti-FimH antibody-coated surfaces showed essentially the opposite behaviour, detaching when the shear stress was increased. These results can be explained if FimH is force-activated; that is, that FimH mediates 'catch-bonds' with mannose that are strengthened by tensile mechanical force. As a result, on monomannose-coated surfaces, bacteria displayed a complex 'stick-and-roll' adhesion in which they tended to roll over the surface at low shear but increasingly halted to stick firmly as the shear was increased. Mutations in FimH that were predicted earlier to increase or decrease force-induced conformational changes in FimH were furthermore shown here to increase or decrease the probability that bacteria exhibited the stationary versus the rolling mode of adhesion. This 'stick-and-roll' adhesion could allow type 1 fimbriated bacteria to move along mannosylated surfaces under relatively low flow conditions and to accumulate preferentially in high shear regions.},

abstract = {Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus are the most frequent causes of nosocomial infections and infections on indwelling medical devices, which characteristically involve biofilms. Recent advances in staphylococcal molecular biology have provided more detailed insight into the basis of biofilm formation in these opportunistic pathogens. A series of surface proteins mediate initial attachment to host matrix proteins, which is followed by the expression of a cationic glucosamine-based exopolysaccharide that aggregates the bacterial cells. In some cases, proteins may function as alternative aggregating substances. Furthermore, surfactant peptides have now been recognized as key factors involved in generating the three-dimensional structure of a staphylococcal biofilm by cell-cell disruptive forces, which eventually may lead to the detachment of entire cell clusters. Transcriptional profiling experiments have defined the specific physiology of staphylococcal biofilms and demonstrated that biofilm resistance to antimicrobials is due to gene-regulated processes. Finally, novel animal models of staphylococcal biofilm-associated infection have given us important information on which factors define biofilm formation in vivo. These recent advances constitute an important basis for the development of anti-staphylococcal drugs and vaccines.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine whether an over-stimulation of the vestibular system, induced by thousands of time saccadic head stimulations, affects the vestibular sensitivity, and consequently if such a phenomenon could contribute to the deterioration of postural stability observed after a long distance running exercise. Eighteen athletic subjects performed a 20.5 km over ground race with an average speed of 15 km x h(-1), corresponding roughly to 7,500 strides shocks with associated saccadic accelerations transmitted to the head. A preliminary validation of the exercise protocol was realized to confirm the effect of the sustained exercise on body balance by recording standard postural parameters. A visually perceived eye level (VPEL) task was used to indirectly assess otolithic sensitivity motionless or undergoing low centrifugation conditions, before and after exercise. Results obtained from body balance analysis confirmed a decreased postural stability illustrated by increased postural oscillations after the 20.5 km run. Under low centrifugation conditions, results showed a lowering of the VPEL with the increase of the gravito-inertial acceleration in accordance with the literature. However, no significant change in the VPEL after a sustained running exercise was observed. In conclusion, the vestibular sensitivity at the otolithic level does not seem to be altered by an intensive running exercise and then failed to play a key role in the post-exercise deterioration of postural stability.},

abstract = {Class 5 fimbriae of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) comprise eight serologically discrete colonization factors that mediate small intestinal adhesion. Their differentiation has been attributed to the pressure imposed by host adaptive immunity. We sequenced the major pilin and minor adhesin subunit genes of a geographically diverse population of ETEC elaborating CFA/I (n = 31), CS17 (n = 20), and CS2 (n = 18) and elucidated the functional effect of microevolutionary processes. Between the fimbrial types, the pairwise nucleotide diversity for the pilin or adhesin genes ranged from 35-43{\%}. Within each fimbrial type, there were 17 non-synonymous and 1 synonymous point mutations among all pilin or adhesin gene copies, implying that each fimbrial type was acquired by ETEC strains very recently, consistent with a recent origin of this E. coli pathotype. The 17 non-synonymous allelic differences occurred in the CFA/I pilin gene cfaB (two changes) and adhesin gene cfaE (three changes), and CS17 adhesin gene csbD (12 changes). All but one amino acid change in the adhesins clustered around the predicted ligand-binding pocket. Functionally, these changes conferred an increase in cell adhesion in a flow chamber assay. In contrast, the two mutations in the non-adhesive CfaB subunit localized to the intersubunit interface and significantly reduced fimbrial adhesion in this assay. In conclusion, naturally occurring mutations in the ETEC adhesive and non-adhesive subunits altered function, were acquired under positive selection, and are predicted to impact bacteria-host interactions.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli causes about 90{\%} of urinary tract infections (UTI), and more than 95{\%} of all UTI-causing E. coli express type 1 fimbriae. The fimbrial tip-positioned adhesive protein FimH utilizes a shear force-enhanced, so-called catch-bond mechanism of interaction with its receptor, mannose, where the lectin domain of FimH shifts from a low- to a high-affinity conformation upon separation from the anchoring pilin domain. Here, we show that immunization with the lectin domain induces antibodies that exclusively or predominantly recognize only the high-affinity conformation. In the lectin domain, we identified four high-affinity-specific epitopes, all positioned away from the mannose-binding pocket, which are recognized by 20 separate clones of monoclonal antibody. None of the monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against the lectin domain inhibited the adhesive function. On the contrary, the antibodies enhanced FimH-mediated binding to mannosylated ligands and increased by severalfold bacterial adhesion to urothelial cells. Furthermore, by natural conversion from the high- to the low-affinity state, FimH adhesin was able to shed the antibodies bound to it. When whole fimbriae were used, the antifimbrial immune serum that contained a significant amount of antibodies against the lectin domain of FimH was also able to enhance FimH-mediated binding. Thus, bacterial adhesins (or other surface antigens) with the ability to switch between alternative conformations have the potential to induce a conformation-specific immune response that has a function-enhancing rather than -inhibiting impact on the protein. These observations have implications for the development of adhesin-specific vaccines and may serve as a paradigm for antibody-mediated enhancement of pathogen binding.},

abstract = {The operating microscope is a fixture of modern surgical facilities, and it is a critically important factor in the success of many of the most complex and difficult surgical interventions used in medicine today. The rise of this key surgical tool reflects advances in understanding the principles of optics and vision that have occurred over centuries. The development of reading spectacles in the late 13th century led to the construction of early compound microscopes in the 16th and 17th centuries by Lippershey, Janssen, Galileo, Hooke, and others. Perhaps surprisingly, Leeuwenhoek's simple microscopes of this era offered improved performance over his contemporaries' designs. The intervening years saw improvements that reduced the spherical and chromatic aberrations present in compound microscopes. By the late 19th century, Carl Zeiss and Ernst Abbe ushered the compound microscope into the beginnings of the modern era of commercial design and production. The introduction of the microscope into the operating room by Nyl{\'{e}}n in 1921 initiated a revolution in surgical practice that gained momentum throughout the 1950s with multiple refinements, the introduction of the Zeiss OPMI series, and Kurze's application of the microscope to neurosurgery in 1957. Many of the refinements of the last 50 years have greatly improved the handling and practical operation of the surgical microscope, considerations which are equally important to its optical performance. Today's sophisticated operating microscopes allow for advanced real-time angiographic and tumor imaging. In this paper the authors discuss what might be found in the operating rooms of tomorrow.},

abstract = {One of the most exciting discoveries in biological adhesion is the recent and counter-intuitive observation that the lifetimes of some biological adhesive bonds, called catch bonds, are enhanced by tensile mechanical force. At least two types of adhesive proteins have been shown to form catch bonds—blood proteins called selectins and a bacterial protein called FimH. Both mediate shear-enhanced adhesion, in which cells bind more strongly at high shear than at low shear. Single-molecule experiments and cell-free assays have now clearly demonstrated that catch bonds exist and mediate shear-enhanced adhesion. However, the mechanics of cellular organelles also contribute to shear-enhanced adhesion by modulating the force applied to catch bonds. This review examines how individual catch bond behavior contributes to shear-enhanced cellular adhesion for the two best-understood examples. The lessons from these systems offer design principles for understanding other types of shear-enhanced adhesion and for engineering nanostructured force-dependent adhesives out of catch bonds.},

The regulatory protein PapB of P fimbriae has previously been implicated in potential coregulatory events. The focB gene of the F1C fimbria determinant is highly homologous to papB; the translated sequences share 81{\%} identity. In this study we investigated the role of PapB and FocB in regulation of the F1C fimbriae. By using gel mobility shift assays, we showed that FocB binds to sequences in both the pap and foc operons in a somewhat different manner than PapB. The results of both in vitro cross-linking and in vivo oligomerization tests indicated that FocB could function in an oligomeric fashion. Furthermore, our results suggest that PapB and FocB can form heterodimers and that these complexes can repress expression of the foc operon. The effect of FocB on expression of type 1 fimbriae was also tested. Taken together, the results that we present expand our knowledge about a regulatory network for different adhesin gene systems in uropathogenic E. coli and suggest a hierarchy for expression of the fimbrial adhesins.},

This review considers what is known about the mode of action and spectrum of activity of antiseptics and disinfectants. The widespread use of these products has prompted some speculation on the development of microbial resistance, in particular whether antibiotic resistance is induced by antiseptics or disinfectants. Known mechanisms of microbial resistance (both intrinsic and acquired) to biocides are reviewed, with emphasis on the clinical implications of these reports.},

abstract = {Under a stretching force, the sugar ring of polysaccharide molecules switches from the chair to the boat-like or inverted chair conformation. This conformational change can be observed by stretching single polysaccharide molecules with an atomic force microscope. In those early experiments, the molecules were stretched at a constant rate while the resulting force changed over wide ranges. However, because the rings undergo force-dependent transitions, an experimental arrangement where the force is the free variable introduces an undesirable level of complexity in the results. Here we demonstrate the use of force-ramp atomic force microscopy to capture the conformational changes in single polysaccharide molecules. Force-ramp atomic force microscopy readily captures the ring transitions under conditions where the entropic elasticity of the molecule is separated from its conformational transitions, enabling a quantitative analysis of the data with a simple two-state model. This analysis directly provides the physico-chemical characteristics of the ring transitions such as the width of the energy barrier, the relative energy of the conformers, and their enthalpic elasticity. Our experiments enhance the ability of single-molecule force spectroscopy to make high-resolution measurements of the conformations of single polysaccharide molecules under a stretching force, making an important addition to polysaccharide spectroscopy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Child survival efforts can be effective only if they are based on accurate information about causes of deaths. Here, we report on a 4-year effort by WHO to improve the accuracy of this information.

METHODS: WHO established the external Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) in 2001 to develop estimates of the proportion of deaths in children younger than age 5 years attributable to pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria, measles, and the major causes of death in the first 28 days of life. Various methods, including single-cause and multi-cause proportionate mortality models, were used. The role of undernutrition as an underlying cause of death was estimated in collaboration with CHERG.

FINDINGS: In 2000-03, six causes accounted for 73{\%} of the 10.6 million yearly deaths in children younger than age 5 years: pneumonia (19{\%}), diarrhoea (18{\%}), malaria (8{\%}), neonatal pneumonia or sepsis (10{\%}), preterm delivery (10{\%}), and asphyxia at birth (8{\%}). The four communicable disease categories account for more than half (54{\%}) of all child deaths. The greatest communicable disease killers are similar in all WHO regions with the exception of malaria; 94{\%} of global deaths attributable to this disease occur in the Africa region. Undernutrition is an underlying cause of 53{\%} of all deaths in children younger than age 5 years.

INTERPRETATION: Achievement of the millennium development goal of reducing child mortality by two-thirds from the 1990 rate will depend on renewed efforts to prevent and control pneumonia, diarrhoea, and undernutrition in all WHO regions, and malaria in the Africa region. In all regions, deaths in the neonatal period, primarily due to preterm delivery, sepsis or pneumonia, and birth asphyxia should also be addressed. These estimates of the causes of child deaths should be used to guide public-health policies and programmes.},

abstract = {Optical tweezers are widely used to measure molecular forces in biology. Such measurements are often influenced by a nearby surface that can perturb both the calibration of the tweezers as well as the hydrodynamic forces acting on microspheres to which the biomolecules are attached. In this study, we have used a very stable optical tweezers setup employing a recently developed calibration method (Toli{\'{c}}-N{\o}rrelykke, S. F.; Sch{\"{a}}ffer, E.; Howard, J.; Pavone, F. S.; J{\"{u}}licher, F.; Flyvbjerg, H. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2006, 77 (10), 103101) to determine how the calibration of the tweezers and the forces on the microspheres depend on the height above the surface. We show that the displacement sensitivity of the tweezers is modulated by a standing light wave between the microsphere and the surface. We measured the dependence of the drag coefficient on height and compared it to exact and closed-form solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. Also, we measured the surface force gradients in different salt solutions and for different surface blocking methods. For a given blocking method, our data suggest that microspheres can experience attractive and/or repulsive forces close to surfaces. For example, a Teflon layer reduces attractive interactions, and the presence of casein can lead to long-range repulsive interactions. These measurements are a prerequisite for the accurate measurement of normal forces with respect to an interface that occur in biological molecules held between surfaces.},

A specific rabbit antiserum raised against the purified 20.8-kDa protein bound specifically to the fimbriae, as shown by immunoelectron microscopy, and inhibited bacterial adhesion to tissue-cultured Caco-2 cells. Transformation with a recombinant plasmid harboring the cfaD gene, which encodes a positive regulator for several ETEC fimbriae, induced hyperexpression of the 20.8-kDa fimbrial subunit and a substantial increase in the proportion of bacterial cells that were fimbriated. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the polypeptide showed 65 and 60{\%} identity to the PCFO20 and 987P fimbriae of human and porcine ETEC, respectively.

abstract = {Urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli are associated with a local and systemic antibody response. We have studied the serum and urine antibody responses to Escherichia coli in men and women with pyelonephritis, cystitis, and asymptomatic bacteriuria. Protein immunoblots consistently demonstrated serum antibody response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Anti-LPS antibody titres rose significantly and progressively when comparing acute with convalescent sera in those who have had their first urinary infection. For those with repeated infections, high titre LPS antibodies were present and did not change significantly between acute and convalescent sera. Antibody responses to the major outer membrane proteins were present but did not differ significantly when compared with normal human serum. A specific anti-P pilus antibody response was demonstrated by immunoblotting. Anti-P pilus antibody was quantitated using ELISA and the titres were found to be very low. Three other techniques were also used to demonstrate the presence of serum antibody. Antibody was detectable by immunofluorescence, but the antigenic specificity of the antibody was more difficult to ascertain. Immunoprecipitation was more specific for determining the nature of the antibody response. Lastly, immunoelectron microscopy was valuable in demonstrating antipilus and antiflagellar antibodies. Immunoelectron microscopy and immunoblotting provided evidence that human antiserum to P pili was modestly cross-reactive and could bind heterologous P pili. These studies indicated that the major antibody response in humans occurs after pyelonephritis and is directed against LPS. An anti-P pilus response is frequently present and is cross-reactive to some extent with other P pili.},

The simulations indicate that histatin-5 is destabilized in water and begins to unfold after 250 ps, while in organic solvent it maintains a regular secondary structure throughout the trajectory. Analysis of the peptide-solvent hydrogen bonds indicates that 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is a poorer proton acceptor than water. The fluorine atom of the alcohol is almost never engaged in a hydrogen bond and the organic solvent interacts mainly with the peptide through its hydroxyl group. For some residues analysis of the solvent residence time indicated longer values for 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol than for water. The most striking difference is related to the number of times the solvent enters and leaves the first coordination shell of the peptide. This value was more than one order of magnitude higher for water than for the alcohol, suggesting that this may be the main cause of alpha-helix destabilization perpetrated by water.},

abstract = {Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are stimulus-responsive polymers that contain repeats of five amino acids, Val-Pro-Gly-Xaa-Gly (VPGXG), where Xaa is a guest residue that can be any amino acid with the exception of proline. While studying the conformational mechanics of ELPs over a range of solvent conditions by single-molecule force spectroscopy, we noticed that some force-extension curves showed temperature-independent, extensional transitions that could not be fitted with a freely jointed chain or worm-like chain model. Here we show that the observed molecular elongation results from the force-induced peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerization in prolines, which are repeated every fifth residue in the main chain of ELPs. Control experiments with poly(L-proline) demonstrate the similarity of the conformational transition between poly(L-proline) and ELPs. In contrast, the force-extension behavior of poly(L-lysine) showed no deviation in the relevant force range. Force-extension curves in hysteresis experiments showed an elongational difference between extension and relaxation pathways that suggests that the cis conformational state of the prolines could be exhausted on the time scale of the experiment. We present further computational evidence for this mechanism by Monte Carlo simulation of the force-extension behavior using an elastically coupled, two-state model. We believe ours is the first demonstration of force-induced prolyl cis-trans isomerization in proline-containing polypeptides. Our results suggest that single-molecule force spectroscopy could provide an alternate means to assay this important conformational transition in polypeptides.},

abstract = {Bond dissociation under steadily rising force occurs most frequently at a time governed by the rate of loading (Evans and Ritchie, 1997 Biophys. J. 72:1541-1555). Multiplied by the loading rate, the breakage time specifies the force for most frequent failure (called bond strength) that obeys the same dependence on loading rate. The spectrum of bond strength versus log(loading rate) provides an image of the energy landscape traversed in the course of unbonding. However, when a weak bond is connected to very compliant elements like long polymers, the load applied to the bond does not rise steadily under constant pulling speed. Because of nonsteady loading, the most frequent breakage force can differ significantly from that of a bond loaded at constant rate through stiff linkages. Using generic models for wormlike and freely jointed chains, we have analyzed the kinetic process of failure for a bond loaded by pulling the polymer linkages at constant speed. We find that when linked by either type of polymer chain, a bond is likely to fail at lower force under steady separation than through stiff linkages. Quite unexpectedly, a discontinuous jump can occur in bond strength at slow separation speed in the case of long polymer linkages. We demonstrate that the predictions of strength versus log(loading rate) can rationalize conflicting results obtained recently for unfolding Ig domains along muscle titin with different force techniques.},

The physiological condition of the cells was determined by their ability to maintain a pH gradient across the cell wall; healthy cells are able to maintain a pH gradient over the cell wall, whereas compromised cells are less efficient, thus giving rise to a diminished pH gradient. The pH gradient was measured by fluorescence ratio imaging microscopy by incorporating a pH-sensitive fluorescent probe, green fluorescent protein or 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester, inside the bacterial cells. We used the gram-negative species Escherichia coli and three gram-positive species, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, and Bacillus subtilis. All cells exhibited some degree of physiological damage, but optically trapped E. coli and L. innocua cells and a subpopulation of L. monocytogenes cells, all grown with shaking, showed only a small decrease in pH gradient across the cell wall when trapped by 6 mW of laser power for 60 min. However, another subpopulation of Listeria monocytogenes cells exhibited signs of physiological damage even while trapped at 6 mW, as did B. subtilis cells. Increasing the laser power to 18 mW caused the pH gradient of both Listeria and E. coli cells to decrease within minutes. Moreover, both species of Listeria exhibited more-pronounced physiological damage when grown without shaking than was seen in cells grown with shaking, and the degree of damage is therefore also dependent on the growth conditions.},

abstract = {Much effort is put into minimizing noise in optical tweezers experiments because noise and drift can mask fundamental behaviours of, e. g., single molecule assays. Various initiatives have been taken to reduce or eliminate noise but it has been difficult to quantify their effect. We propose to use Allan variance as a simple and efficient method to quantify noise in optical tweezers setups. We apply the method to determine the optimal measurement time, frequency, and detection scheme, and quantify the effect of acoustic noise in the lab. The method can also be used on-the-fly for determining optimal parameters of running experiments. (C) 2009 Optical Society of America},

Here, we highlight the recent developments in single-molecule nanometry where the position of a single fluorescent molecule can be determined with nanometer precision, reaching the limit imposed by the shot noise, and the relative motion between two molecules can be determined with ∼0.3 nm precision at ∼1 ms time resolution, as well as how these new tools are providing fundamental insights into how motor proteins move on cellular highways. We will also discuss how interactions between three and four fluorescent molecules can be used to measure three and six coordinates, respectively, allowing us to correlate the movements of multiple components. Finally, we will discuss recent progress in combining angstrom-precision optical tweezers with single-molecule fluorescent detection, opening new windows for multi-dimensional single-molecule nanometry for biological physics.},

abstract = {The dynamics of pyeloureteral flow is described when there is no peristalsis and for peristalsis of high and intermediate frequencies, on the assumption that the ureter is uniform except in the mid-ureter and at the outlet. The possibility of upstream transmission of bladder pressure variations to the renal pelvis is considered. The overall behaviour depends on three principal variables, the maximum tube pressure in the contraction waves, the intrinsic peristaltic carrying capacity and the peristaltic frequency f, expressed in the form fT where T is the time for a peristaltic contraction wave to sweep through the ureter. At intermediate peristaltic frequencies (fT less than but comparable with one) oscillatory flow patterns can occur, in which periods of peristaltically driven flow alternate with extraperistaltic periods of flow through the open ureter. The kidney is better isolated from bladder pressure variations when the peristaltic frequency is high, but high peristaltic frequency can by itself lead to elevated renal pelvic pressure if the flow rate is high. Experimental observations in pigs are presented to support these conclusions.},

abstract = {Cystitis is caused by a relatively small number of bacterial species. To colonize and grow in the urinary tract, these organisms have developed and acquired special properties (virulence factors) that allow them to overcome the defences of the urinary tract, particularly clearance by urine flow. These virulence factors are unlikely to be required during transmission from host to host, and sometimes their constitutive expression may actually be disadvantageous. Such factors are therefore regulated by the environment and in a coordinate manner to ensure their most appropriate expression for the conditions encountered. This review focuses on the biology of the urinary tract and the bacterial properties necessary to cause cystitis. The regulation of virulence factors at the different stages of the infection is considered, and a general model for the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection is proposed.},

This represents an important attribute that assists the survival of this bacterium within environments that are both hostile and adverse to proliferation.

abstract = {The effect of flowrate and Reynolds Number, Re, on the spatial distribution of individual Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells during their initial attachment to glass flowcells was observed in a series of time-lapse images obtained over a 56-h period. It was shown that flow affected the distribution at Re > 245. Under laminar flow conditions, Re = 96, the distribution of bacterial cells in 200 sub-areas was accurately predicted by using the Poisson distribution and was not dependent on the orientation or shape of the sub-areas. Under turbulent flow conditions, Re = 2220, cells initially attached in streaks along the line of flow. As bacterial cells accumulated on the surface, the streaks broadened and the distribution became more uniform. Analyses showed that, initially, flow had an effect on cell distribution in the flowcell with Re = 245, with significantly greater effects at higher Re. As the cell surface densities increased, the effect of flow direction on cell distribution decreased. It is concluded that the visco-elastic properties of the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in which the cells are embedded, significantly affect the distribution of attaching cells.},

Specifically, it is assumed that an incompressible viscous fluid fills a half-space bounded by a plane wall and that the fluid flow satisfies stick boundary conditions at the wall. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem shows that the velocity autocorrelation function of the Brownian particle can be calculated from the frequency-dependent admittance valid locally. It is shown that the t(-3/2) long-time tail of the velocity relaxation function, valid in bulk fluid, is obliterated and replaced by a t(-5/2) long-time tail of positive amplitude for motions parallel to the wall and by a t(-5/2) long-time tail of negative amplitude for motions perpendicular to the wall. The latter finding is at variance with an earlier calculation by Gotoh and Kaneda.},

@article{Harris2006,
abstract = {Duplex DNA must remain stable when not in use to protect the genetic material. However, the two strands must be separated whenever genes are copied or expressed to expose the coding strand for synthesis of complementary RNA or DNA bases. Therefore, the double stranded structure must be relatively easy to take apart when required. These conflicting biological requirements have important implications for the mechanical properties of duplex DNA. Considerable insight into the forces required to denature DNA has been provided by nanomanipulation experiments, which measure the mechanical properties of single molecules in the laboratory. This paper describes recent computer simulation methods that have been developed to mimic nanomanipulation experiments and which, quite literally, 'destruction test' duplex DNA in silico. The method is verified by comparison with single molecule stretching experiments that measure the force required to unbind the two DNA strands. The model is then extended to investigate the thermodynamics of DNA bending and twisting. This is of biological importance as the DNA must be very tightly packaged to fit within the nucleus, and is therefore usually found in a highly twisted or supercoiled state (in bacteria) or wrapped tightly around histone proteins into a densely compacted structure (in animals). In particular, these simulations highlight the importance of thermal fluctuations and entropy in determining the biomechanical properties of DNA. This has implications for the action of DNA processing molecular motors, and also for nanotechnology. Biological machines are able to manipulate single molecules reliably on an energy scale comparable to that of thermal noise. The hope is that understanding the statistical mechanisms that a cell uses to achieve this will be invaluable for the future design of 'nanoengines' engineered to perform new technological functions at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {PapC ushers are outer-membrane proteins enabling assembly and secretion of P pili in uropathogenic E. coli. Their translocation domain is a large $\beta$-barrel occluded by a plug domain, which is displaced to allow the translocation of pilus subunits across the membrane. Previous studies suggested that this gating mechanism is controlled by a $\beta$-hairpin and an $\alpha$-helix. To investigate the role of these elements in allosteric signal communication, we developed a method combining evolutionary and molecular dynamics studies of the native translocation domain and mutants lacking the $\beta$-hairpin and/or the $\alpha$-helix. Analysis of a hybrid residue interaction network suggests distinct regions (residue 'communities') within the translocation domain (especially around $\beta$12-$\beta$14) linking these elements, thereby modulating PapC gating. Antibiotic sensitivity and electrophysiology experiments on a set of alanine-substitution mutants confirmed functional roles for four of these communities. This study illuminates the gating mechanism of PapC ushers and its importance in maintaining outer-membrane permeability.},

abstract = {Dynamic force spectroscopy of single molecules is described by a model that predicts a distribution of rupture forces, the corresponding mean rupture force, and variance, which are all amenable to experimental tests. The distribution has a pronounced asymmetry, which has recently been observed experimentally. The mean rupture force follows a (lnV)2/3 dependence on the pulling velocity, V, and differs from earlier predictions. Interestingly, at low pulling velocities, a rebinding process is obtained whose signature is an intermittent behavior of the spring force, which delays the rupture. An extension to include conformational changes of the adhesion complex is proposed, which leads to the possibility of bimodal distributions of rupture forces.},

abstract = {Pili have been identified on the cell surface of Streptococcus pneumoniae, a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In contrast to Gram-negative bacteria, little is known about the structure of native pili in Gram-positive species and their role in pathogenicity. Triple immunoelectron microscopy of the elongated structure showed that purified pili contained RrgB as the major compound, followed by clustered RrgA and individual RrgC molecules on the pilus surface. The arrangement of gold particles displayed a uniform distribution of anti-RrgB antibodies along the whole pilus, forming a backbone structure. Antibodies against RrgA were found along the filament as particulate aggregates of 2-3 units, often co-localised with single RrgC subunits. Structural analysis using cryo electron microscopy and data obtained from freeze drying/metal shadowing technique showed that pili are oligomeric appendages formed by at least two protofilaments arranged in a coiled-coil, compact superstructure of various diameters. Using extracellular matrix proteins in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, ancillary RrgA was identified as the major adhesin of the pilus. Combining the structural and functional data, a model emerges where the pilus RrgB backbone serves as a carrier for surface located adhesive clusters of RrgA that facilitates the interaction with the host.},

abstract = {Rare negative streamwise velocities and extreme wall-normal velocity fluctuations near the wall are investigated for turbulent channel flow at a series of Reynolds numbers based on friction velocity up to Re-tau = 1000. Probability density functions of the wall-shear stress and velocity components are presented as well as joint probability density functions of the velocity components and the pressure. Backflow occurs more often (0.06{\%} at the wall at Re-tau = 1000) and further away (up to y(+) = 8.5) from the wall for increasing Reynolds number. The regions of backflow are circular with an average diameter, based on ensemble averages, of approximately 20 viscous units independent of Reynolds number. A strong oblique vortex outside the viscous sublayer is found to cause this backflow. Extreme wall-normal velocity events occur also more often for increasing Reynolds number. These extreme fluctuations cause high flatness values near the wall (F(v) = 43 at Re-tau = 1000). Positive and negative velocity spikes appear in pairs, located on the two edges of a strong streamwise vortex as documented by Xu et al. [Phys. Fluids 8, 1938 (1996)] for Re-tau = 180. The spikes are elliptical and orientated in streamwise direction with a typical length of 25 and a typical width of 7.5 viscous units at y(+) approximate to 1. The negative spike occurs in a high-speed streak indicating a sweeping motion, while the positive spike is located in between a high and low-speed streak. The joint probability density functions of negative streamwise and extreme wall-normal velocity events show that these events are largely uncorrelated. The majority of both type of events can be found lying underneath a large-scale structure in the outer region with positive sign, which can be understood by considering the more intense velocity fluctuations due to amplitude modulation of the inner layer by the outer layer. Simulations performed at different resolutions give only minor differences. Results from experiments and recent turbulent boundary layer simulations show similar results indicating that these rare events are universal for wall-bounded flows. In order to detect these rare events in experiments, measurement techniques have to be specifically tuned. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3696304]},

The principle function of these proteins is to bind cells together and resist mechanical force. Adhesive proteins also enable migrating cells to adhere and roll on surfaces even in the presence of shear forces exerted by fluid flow. Recently, several experimental and theoretical studies have provided quantitative insights into the physical mechanisms by which adhesion proteins modulate their unbinding kinetics in response to tensile force. This perspective reviews these biophysical investigations. We focus on single molecule studies of cadherins, selectins, integrins, the von Willebrand factor and FimH adhesion proteins; the effect of mechanical force on the lifetime of these interactions has been extensively characterized. We review both theoretical models and experimental investigations and discuss future directions in this exciting area of research.},

Curr Opin Microbiol 2007, 10:510-516]. Here, we focus on research strategies for putting these methods into practice in the laboratory setting. An immediate consequence of single-cell sequencing is that it provides an alternative to culturing organisms as a prerequisite for genomic sequencing. The microgram amounts of DNA required as template are amplified from a single bacterium by a method called multiple displacement amplification (MDA) avoiding the need to grow cells. The ability to sequence DNA from individual cells will likely have an immense impact on microbiology considering the vast numbers of novel organisms, which have been inaccessible unless culture-independent methods could be used. However, special approaches have been necessary to work with amplified DNA. MDA may not recover the entire genome from the single copy present in most bacteria. Also, some sequence rearrangements can occur during the DNA amplification reaction. Over the past two years many research groups have begun to use MDA, and some practical approaches to single-cell sequencing have been developed. We review the consensus that is emerging on optimum methods, reliability of amplified template, and the proper interpretation of 'composite' genomes which result from the necessity of combining data from several single-cell MDA reactions in order to complete the assembly. Preferred laboratory methods are considered on the basis of experience at several large sequencing centers where >70{\%} of genomes are now often recovered from single cells. Methods are reviewed for preparation of bacterial fractions from environmental samples, single-cell isolation, DNA amplification by MDA, and DNA sequencing.},

@article{Aprikian2011a,
abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the catch bond mechanism, where binding becomes stronger under tensile force, is a common property among non-covalent interactions between biological molecules that are exposed to mechanical force in vivo. Here, by using the multi-protein tip complex of the mannose-binding type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli, we show how the entire quaternary structure of the adhesive organella is adapted to facilitate binding under mechanically dynamic conditions induced by flow. The fimbrial tip mediates shear-dependent adhesion of bacteria to uroepithelial cells and demonstrates force-enhanced interaction with mannose in single molecule force spectroscopy experiments. The mannose-binding, lectin domain of the apex-positioned adhesive protein FimH is docked to the anchoring pilin domain in a distinct hooked manner. The hooked conformation is highly stable in molecular dynamics simulations under no force conditions but permits an easy separation of the domains upon application of an external tensile force, allowing the lectin domain to switch from a low- to a high-affinity state. The conformation between the FimH pilin domain and the following FimG subunit of the tip is open and stable even when tensile force is applied, providing an extended lever arm for the hook unhinging under shear. Finally, the conformation between FimG and FimF subunits is highly flexible even in the absence of tensile force, conferring to the FimH adhesin an exploratory function and high binding rates. The fimbrial tip of type 1 Escherichia coli is optimized to have a dual functionality: flexible exploration and force sensing. Comparison to other structures suggests that this property is common in unrelated bacterial and eukaryotic adhesive complexes that must function in dynamic conditions.},

This scenario is completely different from polyelectrolyte brushes whose collapse is simply driven by pure Coulombic screening, for example, in the presence of Cl- anions.

abstract = {The interaction of proteins at cellular interfaces is critical for many biological processes, from intercellular signaling to cell adhesion. For example, the selectin family of adhesion receptors plays a critical role in trafficking during inflammation and immunosurveillance. Quantitative measurements of binding rates between surface-constrained proteins elicit insight into how molecular structural details and post-translational modifications contribute to function. However, nano-scale transport effects can obfuscate measurements in experimental assays. We constructed a biophysical simulation of the motion of a rigid microsphere coated with biomolecular adhesion receptors in shearing flow undergoing thermal motion. The simulation enabled in silico investigation of the effects of kinetic force dependence, molecular deformation, grouping adhesion receptors into clusters, surface-constrained bond formation, and nano-scale vertical transport on outputs that directly map to observable motions. Simulations recreated the jerky, discrete stop-and-go motions observed in P-selectin/PSGL-1 microbead assays with physiologic ligand densities. Motion statistics tied detailed simulated motion data to experimentally reported quantities. New deductions about biomolecular function for P-selectin/PSGL-1 interactions were made. Distributing adhesive forces among P-selectin/PSGL-1 molecules closely grouped in clusters was necessary to achieve bond lifetimes observed in microbead assays. Initial, capturing bond formation effectively occurred across the entire molecular contour length. However, subsequent rebinding events were enhanced by the reduced separation distance following the initial capture. The result demonstrates that vertical transport can contribute to an enhancement in the apparent bond formation rate. A detailed analysis of in silico motions prompted the proposition of wobble autocorrelation as an indicator of two-dimensional function. Insight into two-dimensional bond formation gained from flow cell assays might therefore be important to understand processes involving extended cellular interactions, such as immunological synapse formation. A biologically informative in silico system was created with minimal, high-confidence inputs. Incorporating random effects in surface separation through thermal motion enabled new deductions of the effects of surface-constrained biomolecular function. Important molecular information is embedded in the patterns and statistics of motion.},

abstract = {Force spectroscopy and recognition imaging are important techniques for characterizing and mapping molecular interactions. In both cases, an antibody is pulled away from its target in times that are much less than the normal residence time of the antibody on its target. The distribution of pulling lengths in force spectroscopy shows the development of additional peaks at high loading rates, indicating that part of the antibody frequently unfolds. This propensity to unfold is reversible, indicating that exposure to high loading rates induces a structural transition to a metastable state. Weakened interactions of the antibody in this metastable state could account for reduced specificity in recognition imaging where the loading rates are always high. The much weaker interaction between the partially unfolded antibody and target, while still specific (as shown by control experiments), results in unbinding on millisecond timescales, giving rise to rapid switching noise in the recognition images. At the lower loading rates used in force spectroscopy, we still find discrepancies between the binding kinetics determined by force spectroscopy and those determined by surface plasmon resonance-possibly a consequence of the short tethers used in recognition imaging. Recognition imaging is nonetheless a powerful tool for interpreting complex atomic force microscopy images, so long as specificity is calibrated in situ, and not inferred from equilibrium binding kinetics.},

As a safe alternative to the prophylactic use of antibiotics, a hyperimmune bovine milk antibody product with specific activity against purified colonization factor antigens (CFAs) was developed and evaluated in a human challenge study. Twenty-five healthy adult volunteers were challenged orally with 10(9) cfu of a virulent CFA/I-bearing ETEC. In the randomized double-blind trial, 7 of 10 volunteers receiving a lactose-free placebo developed clinical diarrhea after challenge, compared with only 1 of 15 cases in volunteers receiving active product (Fisher's exact test, P < .0017). It is concluded that antibodies against CFAs alone are sufficient for protection and that prophylaxis with milk-derived immunoglobulin is a feasible alternative to existing drug interventions.},

abstract = {Most human pyelonephritis Escherichia coli isolates express both mannose (MS)- and globoside (Gal-Gal)-binding pili. An ascending E. coli urinary tract infection model was established in the 16-wk-old female BALB/c mouse to compare the pathogenic significance of MS and Gal-Gal pili and their efficacy as vaccines for the prevention of pyelonephritis. The distribution and density of pilus receptor compounds in urogenital tissues and as soluble compounds in urine were determined with antibodies to the synthetic receptor analogues, alpha D-Gal(1----4) beta D-Gal and alpha D-Man(1----2) alpha D-Man. Both carbohydrates were detected in vagina, bladder, ureter, and renal pelvis epithelium and in collecting duct and tubular cells. A pilus receptor compound also was detected in urine. It competitively inhibited the binding capacity of MS pili and was found to be physically, chemically, and immunologically related to Tamm-Horsfall uromucoid. Infectivity and invasiveness were quantitatively and histologically characterized for four E. coli strains: J96, a human pyelonephritis strain that expresses both MS and Gal-Gal pili; two recombinant strains prepared from J96 chromosomal DNA encoding MS pili or Gal-Gal pili; and the nonpiliated K12 recipient. Intravesicular administration of J96 (10(6) colony-forming units [CFU]) resulted in renal colonization and invasion in each of nine mice. The Gal-Gal clone (10(6) CFU) colonized the kidneys in each of 10 mice but did not invade. In contrast, the MS clone (10(6) CFU) did not colonize renal epithelium or invade. This effect was superceded when larger doses (greater than or equal to 10(10) CFU) of the MS clone were administered in volumes that cause acute vesicoureteric reflux. The efficacy was determined of vaccines composed of pure MS or Gal-Gal pili or the lipopolysaccharide containing O somatic antigen of the challenge strain, J96. The Gal-Gal pilus vaccine blocked renal colonization in 19 of 22 mice and renal invasion in 10 of 11 mice. Gal-Gal pili may be useful immunogens for the prevention of pyelonephritis in anatomically normal urinary tracts.},

These methods are starting to become a bottleneck in some analysis pipelines when faced with data sets of the size of many thousands of sequences. Some methods allow computation of larger data sets while sacrificing quality, and others produce high-quality alignments, but scale badly with the number of sequences. In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

Biofilm formation appears early in the fossil record (approximately 3.25 billion years ago) and is common throughout a diverse range of organisms in both the Archaea and Bacteria lineages, including the 'living fossils' in the most deeply dividing branches of the phylogenetic tree. It is evident that biofilm formation is an ancient and integral component of the prokaryotic life cycle, and is a key factor for survival in diverse environments. Recent advances show that biofilms are structurally complex, dynamic systems with attributes of both primordial multicellular organisms and multifaceted ecosystems. Biofilm formation represents a protected mode of growth that allows cells to survive in hostile environments and also disperse to colonize new niches. The implications of these survival and propagative mechanisms in the context of both the natural environment and infectious diseases are discussed in this review.},

abstract = {Optical tweezers, based on a compact diode pumped Nd:YAG laser providing 350 mW at 1,064 nm coupled into a Zeiss IM 35 microscope, were used to sort CD4+ T cells into a capillary for further mechanical handling and to establish contact between single human natural killer (NK) cells and human erythroleukemia cells (K562) as targets. After contact and a lag phase of a few tens of seconds, the target cell starts to change its morphology and membrane blebbing occurs. The kinetics of the attack of the NK cell on K562 cells is not straightforward but governed by temporal oscillations in the shape of the target cell (zeosis). In a second application, the optical tweezers are combined with a UV laser microbeam based on a pulsed UV laser and with flow cytometry and sorting. With the pulsed laser, segments of sorted chromosome 1 of the chinese hamster karyotype (CHV 79) can be easily micro-dissected and subsequently collected using the optical tweezers. This allows preparation of a few hundred chromosome segments per day without mechanical contact and in an absolutely sterile way and thus may provide an interesting basic technique in any type of genome sequencing project.},

The velocity autocorrelation function exhibits a complex interplay due to the momentum relaxation of the particle, the vortex diffusion in the fluid, the obstruction of flow close to the interface, and the harmonic restoring forces due to the optical trap. We show that already a weak trapping force has a significant impact on the velocity autocorrelation function C(t)=v(t)v(0) at times where the hydrodynamic memory leads to an algebraic decay. The long-time behavior for the motion parallel and perpendicular to the wall is derived analytically and compared to numerical results. Then, we discuss the power spectral densities of the displacement and provide simple interpolation formulas. The theoretical predictions are finally compared to recent experimental observations.},

P pili, whose main part constitutes the PapA rod, composed of approximately 10(3) PapA subunits in a helical arrangement, are distributed over the bacterial surface and mediate adhesion to host cells. They are particularly important in the pathogenesis of E. coli colonizing the upper urinary tract and kidneys. A biological model system has been established for in situ measurements of the forces that occur during mechanical stretching of pili. A mathematical model of the force-versus-elongation behavior of an individual pilus has been developed. Three elongation regions of pili were identified. In region I, P pili stretch elastically, up to a relative elongation of 16 +/- 3{\%}. The product of elasticity modulus and area of a P pilus, EA, was assessed to 154 +/- 20 pN (n=6). In region II, the quaternary structure of the PapA rod unfolds under a constant force of 27 +/- 2 pN (n approximately 100) by a sequential breaking of the interactions between adjacent layers of PapA subunits. This unfolding can elongate the pilus up to 7 +/- 2 times. In region III, pili elongate in a nonlinear manner as a result of stretching until the bond ruptures.},

It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides, which have been isolated from many bacteria, fungi, plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, are an important component of the natural defenses of most living organisms. The isolated peptides are very heterogeneous in length, sequence and structure, but most of them are small, cationic and amphipathic. These peptides exhibit broad-spectrum activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, fungi and enveloped viruses. A wide variety of human proteins and peptides also have antimicrobial activity and play important roles in innate immunity. In this review we discuss three important groups of human antimicrobial peptides. The defensins are cationic non-glycosylated peptides containing six cysteine residues that form three intramolecular disulfide bridges, resulting in a triple-stranded beta-sheet structure. In humans, two classes of defensins can be found: alpha-defensins and beta-defensins. The defensin-related HE2 isoforms will also be discussed. The second group is the family of histatins, which are small, cationic, histidine-rich peptides present in human saliva. Histatins adopt a random coil conformation in aqueous solvents and form alpha-helices in non-aqueous solvents. The third group comprises only one antimicrobial peptide, the cathelicidin LL-37. This peptide is derived proteolytically from the C-terminal end of the human CAP18 protein. Just like the histatins, it adopts a largely random coil conformation in a hydrophilic environment, and forms an alpha-helical structure in a hydrophobic environment.},

abstract = {P pili are fimbrial adhesion organelles expressed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli in the upper urinary tract. They constitute a stiff helix-like polymer consisting of a number of subunits joined by head-to-tail bonds. The elongation and retraction properties of individual P pili exposed to strain have been modeled by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The simulation model is based upon a three-state energy landscape that deforms under an applied force. Bond opening and closure are modeled by Bells theory while the elongation of the linearized part of the pilus is described by a worm-like chain model. The simulations are compared with measurements made by force measuring optical tweezers. It was found that the simulations can reproduce pili elongation as well as retraction, under both equilibrium and dynamic conditions, including entropic effects. It is shown that the simulations allow for an assessment of various model parameters, e.g. the unfolding force, energy barrier heights, and various distances in the energy landscape, including their stochastic spread that analytical models are unable to do. The results demonstrate that MC simulations are useful to model elongation and retraction properties of P pili, and therefore presumably also other types of pili, exposed to strain and/or stress. MC simulations are particularly suited for description of helix-like pili since these have an intricate self-regulating mechanical elongation behavior that makes analytical descriptions non-trivial when dynamic processes are studied, or if additional interactions in the rod or the behavior of the adhesion tip needs to be modeled.},

Eight E. coli pathovars have been well characterized, and each uses a large arsenal of virulence factors to subvert host cellular functions to potentiate its virulence. In this Review, we focus on the recent advances in our understanding of the different pathogenic mechanisms that are used by various E. coli pathovars and how they cause disease in humans.},

abstract = {We report a novel fiber probe based Raman detection system on a microfluidic platform where a split Raman probe is directly embedded into a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) chip. In contrast to previous Raman detection schemes in microfluidics, probe based detection offers reduced background and portability. Compared to conventional backscattering probe designs, the split fiber probe we used in this system, results in a reduced size and offers flexibility to modify the collection geometry to minimize the background generated by the fibers. Also our microfluidic chip design enables us to obtain an alignment free system. As a proof of concept we demonstrate the sensitivity of the device for urea detection at relevant human physiological levels with a low acquisition time. The development of this system on a microfluidic platform means portable, lab on a chip devices for biological analyte detection and environmental sensing using Raman spectroscopy are now within reach.},

Here we present the development of an ultra-stable optical trapping system with angstrom-level resolution, which we used to monitor transcriptional elongation by single molecules of Escherichia coli RNAP. Records showed discrete steps averaging 3.7 +/- 0.6 angstrom, a distance equivalent to the mean rise per base found in B-DNA. By combining our results with quantitative gel analysis, we conclude that RNAP advances along DNA by a single base pair per nucleotide addition to the nascent RNA. We also determined the force-velocity relationship for transcription at both saturating and sub-saturating nucleotide concentrations; fits to these data returned a characteristic distance parameter equivalent to one base pair. Global fits were inconsistent with a model for movement incorporating a power stroke tightly coupled to pyrophosphate release, but consistent with a brownian ratchet model incorporating a secondary NTP binding site.},

abstract = {A model of the elongation of P pili expressed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli exposed to stress is presented. The model is based upon the sticky chain concept, which is based upon Hooke's law for elongation of the layer-to-layer and head-to-tail bonds between neighboring units in the PapA rod and a kinetic description of the opening and closing of bonds, described by rate equations and an energy landscape model. It provides an accurate description of the elongation behavior of P pili under stress and supports a hypothesis that the PapA rod shows all three basic stereotypes of elongation/unfolding: elongation of bonds in parallel, the zipper mode of unfolding, and elongation and unfolding of bonds in series. The two first elongation regions are dominated by a cooperative bond opening, in which each bond is influenced by its neighbor, whereas the third region can be described by individual bond opening, in which the bonds open and close randomly. A methodology for a swift extraction of model parameters from force-versus-elongation measurements performed under equilibrium conditions is derived. Entities such as the free energy, the stiffness, the elastic elongation, the opening length of the various bonds, and the number of PapA units in the rod are determined.},

Here we introduce a newly developed assay using OT to investigate the interactions between Protein A from Staphylococcus aureus and Immunoglobulin G from rabbit serum (RIgG). We demonstrate that the rupture forces depend on the loading rate and on the sodium chloride concentration. The measured loading rate effect is well known in the literature and the data we obtained were found to be in good agreement with an already published theoretical model. The dependence of the rupture forces on the salt concentration demonstrates the influence of hydrophobic interactions on the bond strength. Our experimental setup can probe the interaction between a single receptor and its specific ligand under changing conditions and hence offers manifold applications in single molecule biotechnology.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Travellers' diarrhoea is the most common medical complaint among persons venturing into developing areas from industrialized regions.

AIM: To review recent developments dealing with microbiological, clinical, pathophysiological and therapeutic aspects of travellers' diarrhoea.

METHODS: The author's extensive file plus a review of publications listed in PubMed on January 22, 2009 on the topic of travellers' diarrhoea were reviewed.

RESULTS: Travellers' diarrhoea is largely caused by detectable and undetected bacterial enteropathogens, explaining the remarkable effectiveness of antibacterial agents in prophylaxis and therapy of the illness. A number of host genetic polymorphisms have been recently linked with susceptibility to travellers' diarrhoea. Novel antisecretory agents are being developed for treatment considering their physiological effects in acute diarrhoea. All travellers should be armed with one of three antibacterial drugs, ciprofloxacin, rifaximin or azithromycin, before their trips to use in self therapy should diarrhoea occur during travel. Loperamide may treat milder forms of travellers' diarrhoea and can be employed with antibacterial drugs.

CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhoea will continue to plague international travellers to high-risk regions. More studies of the incidence rate, relative important of the various pathogens by geographical region of the world, host risk factors and optimal therapeutic approach are needed.},

abstract = {Many bacteria are characterized by nanoscale ultrastructures, for example S-layers, flagella, fimbriae, or pili. The last two are especially important for attachment to different abiotic and biotic surfaces and for host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we investigated the geometric and elastic properties of pili of different Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We performed quantitative contour-length analysis of bacterial pili and found that the visible contour length of the pili can be described by a log-normal distribution. Our data revealed significant strain-specific variations in the mean visible contour length of the pili, ranging from 260 to 1,590 nm. To estimate their full contour length, which is not directly accessible from the AFM images, we developed a simple correction model. Using this model, we determined the mean full contour length as 510-2,060 nm. To obtain the persistence length we used two different methods of analysis, one based on the end-to-end distance of the pili and one based on the bending angles of short segments. In comparison, the bending angle analysis proved to be more precise and resulted in persistence lengths in the narrow range of 220-280 nm, with no significant strain-specific variations. This is small compared with some other bacterial polymers, for example type IV pili, F-pili, or flagella.},

abstract = {While bio-labeled immunoglobulin (IgG) or antibodies are extensively used in imaging studies and therapeutic modality, there have been no reports describing atomic force microscopy (AFM) micrographs of these labeled IgG molecules. Here, AFM studies of phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated IgG were undertaken to examine whether PE conjugation induced conformational changes or molecular interaction, and subsequently resulted in an alteration in nano-structures of PE-conjugated IgG complex. Once immobilized on mica, single PE-conjugated IgG molecule exhibited globular shape with approximately 60 microns in diameter and 5 microns in height. PE-conjugated IgG were able to form monomers, spindle-like trimers, and hexamers that developed through an end-end connection of two trimers, after they were continuously immobilized on mica. Interestingly, these multimers could aggregate in different directions to form circular monolayers with a highly dense core of PE-conjugated IgG polymers. The formation of these well-organized polymers and aggregates of PE-conjugated IgG may be attributed to the PE conjugation as well as the air-liquid tension on subtract. These findings may help to understand the nano-structures of bio-labeled IgG or antibodies, and facilitate the potential use of PE-conjugated antibodies as markers or immunosensers for AFM bio-analytics of biomolecules in cells and membranes.},

abstract = {The interaction of bacteria with surfaces has important implications in a range of areas, including bioenergy, biofouling, biofilm formation, and the infection of plants and animals. Many of the interactions of bacteria with surfaces produce changes in the expression of genes that influence cell morphology and behavior, including genes essential for motility and surface attachment. Despite the attention that these phenotypes have garnered, the bacterial systems used for sensing and responding to surfaces are still not well understood. An understanding of these mechanisms will guide the development of new classes of materials that inhibit and promote cell growth, and complement studies of the physiology of bacteria in contact with surfaces. Recent studies from a range of fields in science and engineering are poised to guide future investigations in this area. This review summarizes recent studies on bacteria-surface interactions, discusses mechanisms of surface sensing and consequences of cell attachment, provides an overview of surfaces that have been used in bacterial studies, and highlights unanswered questions in this field.},

abstract = {Leukocyte adhesion under flow in the microvasculature is mediated by binding between cell surface receptors and complementary ligands expressed on the surface of the endothelium. Leukocytes adhere to endothelium in a two-step mechanism: rolling (primarily mediated by selectins) followed by firm adhesion (primarily mediated by integrins). Using a computational method called "Adhesive Dynamics," we have simulated the adhesion of a cell to a surface in flow, and elucidated the relationship between receptor-ligand functional properties and the dynamics of adhesion. We express this relationship in a state diagram, a one-to-one map between the biophysical properties of adhesion molecules and various adhesive behaviors. Behaviors that are observed in simulations include firm adhesion, transient adhesion (rolling), and no adhesion. We varied the dissociative properties, association rate, bond elasticity, and shear rate and found that the unstressed dissociation rate, k(r)(o), and the bond interaction length, gamma, are the most important molecular properties controlling the dynamics of adhesion. Experimental k(r)(o) and gamma values from the literature for molecules that are known to mediate rolling adhesion fall within the rolling region of the state diagram. We explain why L-selectin-mediated rolling, which has faster k(r)(o) than other selectins, is accompanied by a smaller value for gamma. We also show how changes in association rate, shear rate, and bond elasticity alter the dynamics of adhesion. The state diagram (which must be mapped for each receptor-ligand system) presents a concise and comprehensive means of understanding the relationship between bond functional properties and the dynamics of adhesion mediated by receptor-ligand bonds.},

abstract = {Tethers are nanocylinders of lipid bilayer membrane, arising in situations ranging from micromanipulation experiments on synthetic vesicles to the formation of dynamic tubular networks in the Golgi apparatus. Relying on the extensive theoretical and experimental works aimed to understand the physics of individual tethers formation, we addressed the problem of the interaction between two nanotubes. By using a combination of micropipette manipulation and optical tweezers, we quantitatively studied the process of coalescence that occurred when the separation distance between both vesicle-tether junctions became smaller than a threshold length. Our experiments, which were supported by an original theoretical analysis, demonstrated that the measurements of the tether force and angle between tethers at coalescence directly yield the bending rigidity, kappa, and the membrane tension, sigma, of the vesicles. Contrary to other methods used to probe the bending rigidity of vesicles, the proposed approach permits a direct measurement of kappa without requiring any control of the membrane tension. Finally, after validation of the method and proposal of possible applications, we experimentally investigated the dynamics of the coalescence process.},

abstract = {The ability to control the dispersion, aggregation, and assembly of colloidal systems is important for a number of applications, for instance, Pickering emulsions, drug and gene delivery, control of fluid rheology, and the formation of colloidal crystal arrays. We generated a responsive colloidal system based on polymer-brush-grafted silica nanoparticles and demonstrated that such a colloidal system can be used to produce stable oil-in-water Pickering emulsions. Cationic poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)-ethyl-trimethyl-ammonium chloride) (PMETAC) brushes were grown from silica nanoparticles (diameter ∼320 nm) through surface-initiated atom-transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). PMETAC brushes are attractive coatings for controlling the behavior of colloidal systems, owing to their ion-specific collapse resulting in the switching of surface hydrophilicity. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta-potential measurements indicated the successful grafting of PMETAC brushes on nanoparticles. The resulting colloidal dispersion was shown to be responsive to perchlorate ions (ClO(4)(-)), which triggered particle aggregation and enabled the generation of Pickering emulsions. The onset of aggregation depended on the polymer chain length. Aggregation was not affected by the initiator density and brush conformational changes. Further studies suggested that particle aggregation and the formation of stable Pickering emulsions were not simply due to brush collapse but also were due to a gradual shielding of electrostatic repulsion. Finally, the stability and homogeneity of the resulting Pickering emulsions were studied.},

abstract = {Staphylococcus epidermidis adhesion onto materials with specific chemical functionalities, under flow, was investigated by using surfaces prepared by self-assembly of alkyl silane monolayers on glass. Terminal methyl (CH(3)) and amino (NH(2)) groups were formed by chemical vapor deposition of silanes, at elevated temperature. Carboxyl (COOH) terminated groups were prepared by further modification of NH(2) groups with succide anhydride and positively charged NH(2) groups by adsorption of poly-L: -lysine hydrobromide. Hydroxyl (OH) terminated glass was used as control. Surface modification was verified by contact angle measurements, atomic force microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. A parallel plate flow chamber was used to evaluate bacterial adhesion at various shear rates. Adhesion was found to be depended on the monolayer's terminal functionality. It was higher on the CH(3) followed by the positively charged NH(2), the non-charged NH(2) groups, the COOH and minimal on the OH-terminated glass. The increase in the material surface free energy significantly reduced the adhesion of a hydrophilic bacterial strain, and this is in accordance with the predictions of the thermodynamic theory. However, the increase in the shear rate restricted the predictability of the theory and revealed macromolecular interactions between bacteria and NH(2)- and COOH-terminated surfaces.},

abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is recognized to be a common cause of acute watery diarrhea in children from developing countries. Colonization factors (CFAs) have been identified predominantly in ETEC isolates secreting heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) or cosecreting ST with a heat-labile toxin (LT). We hypothesized that LT-only-secreting ETEC produces unique colonization factors not previously described in ST and LTST-secreting ETEC. A set of degenerate primers based on nucleotide sequence similarities between the major structural genes of CS20 (csnA), CS18 (fotA), CS12 (cswA), and porcine antigen 987 (fasA) was developed and used to screen a collection of 266 LT-secreting ETEC isolates in which no known CFA was detected. PCR-amplified products of different molecular masses were obtained from 49 (18.4{\%}) isolates. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the PCR amplicons followed by GenBank nucleotide BLASTn analysis revealed five novel DNA sequences; translated amino acid BLASTx analysis confirmed sequence similarity to class 1b major structural proteins encoded by csnA, fotA, and fasA. Strains expressing the novel CFAs were phylotyped and analyzed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST; Achtman scheme), and the types detected were compared to those of a collection of archived global E. coli strains. In conclusion, application of the degenerate primer sets to ETEC isolates from surveillance studies increased the total number of ETEC isolates with detectable CFAs by almost 20{\%}. Additionally, MLST analysis suggests that for many CFAs, there may be a requirement for certain genetic backgrounds to acquire and maintain plasmids carrying genes encoding CFAs.},

Helicobacter pylori colonizes the stomach of over half the world population and is the main cause of peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. It is generally considered to be a non-invasive pathogen present only in the lumen of the stomach and attached to gastric epithelial cells although a number of in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that H. pylori is in fact invasive. In addition, H. pylori can repopulate the extracellular environment after complete elimination of extracellular bacteria with gentamicin, suggesting it may be considered a facultative intracellular bacterium. This review examines the validity of these observations and describes the evidence suggesting that the intracellular presence of H. pylori plays a role in the induction of diseases, in immune evasion, and in life-long persistence of the bacterium in the stomach of a majority of humans.},

abstract = {Pyelonephritic Escherichia coli cause urinary tract infections that involve the kidneys. Initiation of infection is dependent on P-pili expressed on the bacterial surface. In this work, an essential interface for assembly of the helical rod structure of P-pili has been located on the major pilin subunit, PapA. Based on primary sequence alignment, secondary structure analysis, and quaternary structure modeling of the PapA subunit, we predicted the location of a site that is critical for in vivo assembly of the native macromolecular structure of P-pili. A rigid helical rod of PapA subunits comprising most of the pilus length is stabilized by n to n+3 subunit-subunit interactions, and is important for normal function of these pili. Using site-directed mutagenesis, ultrastructural analysis by electron cryomicroscopy, immunocytochemistry, and molecular modeling we show that residues 106-109 (Asn, Gly, Ala, Gly) are essential for assembly of native P-pilus filaments. Mutation of these residues disrupts assembly of the native P-pilus helix. Extended fibrillar structures do still assemble, verifying that n to n+1 subunit-subunit interactions are maintained in the mutant fiber morphology. Observation of this fibrillar morphology in the mutant fiber was predicted by our modeling studies. These mutant P-pili data validate the predictive value of our model for understanding subunit-subunit interactions between PapA monomers. Alteration of the pilus structure from a 7-8 nm helical rod to a 2 nm fibrillar structure may compromise the ability of these bacteria to adhere and remain bound to the host cell, thus providing a possible therapeutic target for antimicrobial drugs.},

abstract = {A mathematical model was developed to quantify the efficiency of cell-substrate attachment in the parallel-plate flow chamber. The model decouples the physical features of the system that affect cell-substrate collision rates from the biological features that influence cellular adhesivity. Thus, experimental data on cell rolling and adhesion density are converted into "frequency" parameters that quantify the "efficiency" with which cells in the flow chamber progress from the free stream to rolling, and transition from rolling to firm arrest. The model was partially validated by comparing simulation results with experiments where neutrophils rolled and adhered onto substrates composed of cotransfected cells bearing E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Results suggest that: 1) Neutrophils contact the E-selectin substrate on average for 4-8.5s before tethering. This contact duration is insensitive to applied shear stress. 2) At 2 dyn/cm(2), approximately 28{\%} of the collisions between the cells and substrate result in primary capture. Also, approximately 5-7{\%} of collisions between neutrophils in the free stream and previously recruited neutrophils bound on the substrate result in secondary capture. These percentages were higher at lower shears. 3) An adherent cell may influence the flow streams in its vicinity up to a distance of 2.5 cell diameters away. 4) Our estimates of selectin on-rate in cellular systems compare favorably with data from reconstituted systems with immobilized soluble E-selectin. In magnitude, the observed on-rates occur in the order, L-selectin > P-selectin > E-selectin.},

abstract = {The most commonly used optical-trapping assays are coupled to surfaces, yet such assays lack atomic-scale ( approximately 0.1 nm) spatial resolution due to drift between the surface and trap. We used active stabilization techniques to minimize surface motion to 0.1 nm in three dimensions and decrease multiple types of trap laser noise (pointing, intensity, mode, and polarization). As a result, we achieved nearly the thermal limit (<0.05 nm) of bead detection over a broad range of trap stiffness (k(T) = 0.05-0.5 pN/nm) and frequency (Deltaf = 0.03-100 Hz). We next demonstrated sensitivity to one-basepair (0.34-nm) steps along DNA in a surface-coupled assay at moderate force (6 pN). Moreover, basepair stability was achieved immediately after substantial (3.4 pN) changes in force. Active intensity stabilization also led to enhanced force precision ( approximately 0.01{\%}) that resolved 0.1-pN force-induced changes in DNA hairpin unfolding dynamics. This work brings the benefit of atomic-scale resolution, currently limited to dual-beam trapping assays, along with enhanced force precision to the widely used, surface-coupled optical-trapping assay.},

abstract = {We present, to our knowledge, a new theory that takes internal dynamics of proteins into account to describe forced-unfolding and force-quench refolding in single molecule experiments. In the current experimental setup (using either atomic force microscopy or laser optical tweezers) the distribution of unfolding times, P(t), is measured by applying a constant stretching force f(S) from which the apparent f(S)-dependent unfolding rate is obtained. To describe the complexity of the underlying energy landscape requires additional probes that can incorporate the dynamics of tension propagation and relaxation of the polypeptide chain upon force quench. We introduce a theory of force correlation spectroscopy to map the parameters of the energy landscape of proteins. In force correlation spectroscopy, the joint distribution P(T, t) of folding and unfolding times is constructed by repeated application of cycles of stretching at constant f(S) separated by release periods T during which the force is quenched to f(Q) < f(S). During the release period, the protein can collapse to a manifold of compact states or refold. We show that P(T, t) at various f(S) and f(Q) values can be used to resolve the kinetics of unfolding as well as formation of native contacts. We also present methods to extract the parameters of the energy landscape using chain extension as the reaction coordinate and P(T, t). The theory and a wormlike chain model for the unfolded states allows us to obtain the persistence length l(p) and the f(Q)-dependent relaxation time, giving us an estimate of collapse timescale at the single molecular level, in the coil states of the polypeptide chain. Thus, a more complete description of landscape of protein native interactions can be mapped out if unfolding time data are collected at several values of f(S) and f(Q). We illustrate the utility of the proposed formalism by analyzing simulations of unfolding-refolding trajectories of a coarse-grained protein (S1) with beta-sheet architecture for several values of f(S), T, and f(Q) = 0. The simulations of stretch-relax trajectories are used to map many of the parameters that characterize the energy landscape of S1.},

abstract = {Replicating bacterial chromosomes continuously demix from each other and segregate within a compact volume inside the cell called the nucleoid. Although many proteins involved in this process have been identified, the nature of the global forces that shape and segregate the chromosomes has remained unclear because of limited knowledge of the micromechanical properties of the chromosome. In this work, we demonstrate experimentally the fundamentally soft nature of the bacterial chromosome and the entropic forces that can compact it in a crowded intracellular environment. We developed a unique "micropiston" and measured the force-compression behavior of single Escherichia coli chromosomes in confinement. Our data show that forces on the order of 100 pN and free energies on the order of 10(5) k(B)T are sufficient to compress the chromosome to its in vivo size. For comparison, the pressure required to hold the chromosome at this size is a thousand-fold smaller than the surrounding turgor pressure inside the cell. Furthermore, by manipulation of molecular crowding conditions (entropic forces), we were able to observe in real time fast (approximately 10 s), abrupt, reversible, and repeatable compaction-decompaction cycles of individual chromosomes in confinement. In contrast, we observed much slower dissociation kinetics of a histone-like protein HU from the whole chromosome during its in vivo to in vitro transition. These results for the first time provide quantitative, experimental support for a physical model in which the bacterial chromosome behaves as a loaded entropic spring in vivo.},

abstract = {The process of surface adhesion and biofilm development is a survival strategy employed by virtually all bacteria and refined over millions of years. This process is designed to anchor microorganisms in a nutritionally advantageous environment and to permit their escape to greener pastures when essential growth factors have been exhausted. Bacterial attachment to a surface can be divided into several distinct phases, including primary and reversible adhesion, secondary and irreversible adhesion, and biofilm formation. Each of these phases is ultimately controlled by the expression of one or more gene products. Ultrastructurally, the mature bacterial biofilm resembles an underwater coral reef containing pyramidal or mushroom-shaped microcolonies of organisms embedded within an extracellular glycocalyx, with channels and cavities to allow the exchange of nutrients and waste. The biofilm protects its inhabitants from predators, dehydration, biocides, and other environmental extremes while regulating population growth and diversity through primitive cell signals. From a physiological standpoint, surface-bound bacteria behave quite differently from their planktonic counterparts. Recognizing that bacteria naturally occur as surface-bound and often polymicrobic communities, the practice of performing antimicrobial susceptibility tests using pure cultures and in a planktonic growth mode should be questioned. That this model does not reflect conditions found in nature might help explain the difficulties encountered in the management and treatment of biomedical implant infections.},

abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are an important cause of diarrheal morbidity in developing countries, especially in children and also of traveler's diarrhea. Colonization factors (CFs) of ETEC, like CFA/I and CS2 which are genetically and structurally related, play a substantial role in pathogenicity, and since intestinal-mucosal immune responses against CFs appear to be protective, much effort has focused on the development of a CF-based ETEC vaccine. We have constructed hybrid operons in which the major CS2 subunit-encoding cotA gene was inserted into the CFA/I operon, either replacing (hybrid I) or being added to the major CFA/I subunit-encoding cfaB gene (hybrid II). Using specific monoclonal antibodies against the major subunits of CFA/I and CS2, high levels of surface expression of both fimbrial subunits were shown in E. coli carrying the hybrid II operon. Oral immunization of mice with formalin-killed bacteria expressing hybrid II fimbriae induced strong CFA/I- and CS2-specific serum IgG + IgM and fecal IgA antibody responses, which were higher than those achieved by similar immunization with the reference strains. Bacteria expressing hybrid fimbriae are potential candidate strains in an oral-killed CF-ETEC vaccine, and the approach represents an attractive and novel means of producing a broad-spectrum ETEC vaccine.},

abstract = {The recent progress made in developing laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has transformed LIBS from an elemental analysis technique to one that can be applied for the reagentless analysis of molecularly complex biological materials or clinical specimens. Rapid advances in the LIBS technology have spawned a growing number of recently published articles in peer-reviewed journals which have consistently demonstrated the capability of LIBS to rapidly detect, biochemically characterize and analyse, and/or accurately identify various biological, biomedical or clinical samples. These analyses are inherently real-time, require no sample preparation, and offer high sensitivity and specificity. This overview of the biomedical applications of LIBS is meant to summarize the research that has been performed to date, as well as to suggest to health care providers several possible specific future applications which, if successfully implemented, would be significantly beneficial to humankind.},

In this protocol, we aim to provide a clear exposition of the methodology of assembling and operating a single-beam gradient force trap (optical tweezers) on an inverted fluorescence microscope.

@article{Schaffer2007d,
abstract = {Optical tweezers are widely used to measure molecular forces in biology. Such measurements are often influenced by a nearby surface that can perturb both the calibration of the tweezers as well as the hydrodynamic forces acting on microspheres to which the biomolecules are attached. In this study, we have used a very stable optical tweezers setup employing a recently developed calibration method (Toli{\'{c}}-N{\o}rrelykke, S. F.; Sch{\"{a}}ffer, E.; Howard, J.; Pavone, F. S.; J{\"{u}}licher, F.; Flyvbjerg, H. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2006, 77 (10), 103101) to determine how the calibration of the tweezers and the forces on the microspheres depend on the height above the surface. We show that the displacement sensitivity of the tweezers is modulated by a standing light wave between the microsphere and the surface. We measured the dependence of the drag coefficient on height and compared it to exact and closed-form solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. Also, we measured the surface force gradients in different salt solutions and for different surface blocking methods. For a given blocking method, our data suggest that microspheres can experience attractive and/or repulsive forces close to surfaces. For example, a Teflon layer reduces attractive interactions, and the presence of casein can lead to long-range repulsive interactions. These measurements are a prerequisite for the accurate measurement of normal forces with respect to an interface that occur in biological molecules held between surfaces.},

Technological improvements in single-molecule methods have made it possible to combine optical tweezers, fluorescence microscopy, and microfluidic flow systems. Such a combination of techniques has opened new possibilities to study complex biochemical reactions on the single-molecule level. In this chapter, we provide general considerations for the development of a combined optical trapping, fluorescence microscopy, and microfluidics instrument, along with methods to solve technical issues that are critical for designing successful experiments. Finally, we present several experiments to illustrate the power of this combination of techniques.},

abstract = {One of the most exciting discoveries in biological adhesion is the recent and counter-intuitive observation that the lifetimes of some biological adhesive bonds, called catch bonds, are enhanced by tensile mechanical force. At least two types of adhesive proteins have been shown to form catch bonds—blood proteins called selectins and a bacterial protein called FimH. Both mediate shear-enhanced adhesion, in which cells bind more strongly at high shear than at low shear. Single-molecule experiments and cell-free assays have now clearly demonstrated that catch bonds exist and mediate shear-enhanced adhesion. However, the mechanics of cellular organelles also contribute to shear-enhanced adhesion by modulating the force applied to catch bonds. This review examines how individual catch bond behavior contributes to shear-enhanced cellular adhesion for the two best-understood examples. The lessons from these systems offer design principles for understanding other types of shear-enhanced adhesion and for engineering nanostructured force-dependent adhesives out of catch bonds.},

abstract = {Biopolymers are vital structures for many living organisms; for a variety of bacteria, adhesion polymers play a crucial role for the initiation of colonization. Some bacteria express, on their surface, attachment organelles (pili) that comprise subunits formed into stiff helix-like structures that possess unique biomechanical properties. These helix-like structures possess a high degree of flexibility that gives the biopolymers a unique extendibility. This has been considered beneficial for piliated bacteria adhering to host surfaces in the presence of a fluid flow. We show in this work that helix-like pili have the ability to act as efficient dampers of force that can, for a limited time, lower the load on the force-mediating adhesin-receptor bond on the tip of an individual pilus. The model presented is applied to bacteria adhering with a single pilus of either of the two most common types expressed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, P or type 1 pili, subjected to realistic flows. The results indicate that for moderate flows ({\~{}}25 mm/s) the force experienced by the adhesin-receptor interaction at the tip of the pilus can be reduced by a factor of {\~{}}6 and {\~{}}4, respectively. The uncoiling ability provides a bacterium with a "go with the flow" possibility that acts as a damping. It is surmised that this can be an important factor for the initial part of the adhesion process, in particular in turbulent flows, and thereby be of use for bacteria in their striving to survive a natural defense such as fluid rinsing actions.},

abstract = {The rapid development of the optical tweezers technique has broadened the applicability of the technique from physics to biology. Although the construction of an optical tweezers system only requires basic skills in optics, the realization of an optical tweezers set LIP is not always as easy as it seems. A number of designs for moveable traps have been presented in the literature. It is not clear to the readers, however, how the movability of the trap affects its quality. We have therefore scrutinized and compared the most commonly used techniques for steering of an optical trap in terms of the aberrations they introduce. The study shows that a moveable trap based on the movement of a lens introduces significantly more aberration than the systems based on fiber optics or the tilting of a mirror.},

The process of bacterial adhesion includes an initial physicochemical interaction phase and a late molecular and cellular one. It is a complicated process influenced by many factors, including the bacterial properties, the material surface characteristics, the environmental factors, such as the presence of serum proteins and the associated flow conditions. Two categories of techniques used in estimating bacteria-material interactions are described: those that utilize fluid flowing against the adhered bacteria and counting the percentage of bacteria that detach, and those that manipulate single bacteria in various configurations which lend themselves to more specific force application and provide the basis for theoretical analysis of the receptor-ligand interactions. The theories that are reviewed are the Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory, the thermodynamic approach and the extended DLVO theory. Over the years, significant work has been done to investigate the process of bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces, however a lot of questions still remain unanswered.},

abstract = {Atherosclerosis of the human arterial system produces major clinical symptoms when the plaque advances to create a high-grade stenosis. The hemodynamic shear rates produced in high-grade stenoses are important in the understanding of atheromatous plaque rupture and thrombosis. This study was designed to quantify the physiologic stress levels experienced by endothelial cells and platelets in the region of vascular stenoses. The steady hemodynamic flow field was solved for stenoses with percent area reductions of 50, 75, and 90 percent over a range of physiologic Reynolds numbers (100-400). The maximum wall shear rate in the throat region can be shown to vary by the square root of the Reynolds number. The shear rate results can be generalized to apply to a range of stenosis lengths and flow rates. Using dimensions typical for a human carotid or coronary artery, wall shear rates were found to vary from a maximum of 20,000 s-1 upstream of the throat to a minimum of -630 s-1 in the recirculation zone for a 90 percent stenosis. An example is given which illustrates how these values can be used to understand the relationship between hemodynamic shear and platelet deposition.},

abstract = {Bacterial adhesion organelles, known as fimbria or pili, are expressed by gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria families. These appendages play a key role in the first steps of the invasion and infection processes, and they therefore provide bacteria with pathogenic abilities. To improve the knowledge of pili-mediated bacterial adhesion to host cells and how these pili behave under the presence of an external force, we first characterize, using force measuring optical tweezers, open coil-like T4 pili expressed by gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae with respect to their biomechanical properties. It is shown that their elongation behavior can be well described by the worm-like chain model and that they possess a large degree of flexibility. Their properties are then compared with those of helix-like pili expressed by gram-negative uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC), which have different pili architecture. The differences suggest that these two types of pili have distinctly dissimilar mechanisms to adhere and sustain external forces. Helix-like pili expressed by UPEC bacteria adhere to host cells by single adhesins located at the distal end of the pili while their helix-like structures act as shock absorbers to dampen the irregularly shear forces induced by urine flow and to increase the cooperativity of the pili ensemble, whereas open coil-like pili expressed by S. pneumoniae adhere to cells by a multitude of adhesins distributed along the pili. It is hypothesized that these two types of pili represent different strategies of adhering to host cells in the presence of external forces. When exposed to significant forces, bacteria expressing helix-like pili remain attached by distributing the external force among a multitude of pili, whereas bacteria expressing open coil-like pili sustain large forces primarily by their multitude of binding adhesins which presumably detach sequentially.},

abstract = {Biopolymers are vital structures for many living organisms; for a variety of bacteria, adhesion polymers play a crucial role for the initiation of colonization. Some bacteria express, on their surface, attachment organelles (pili) that comprise subunits formed into stiff helix-like structures that possess unique biomechanical properties. These helix-like structures possess a high degree of flexibility that gives the biopolymers a unique extendibility. This has been considered beneficial for piliated bacteria adhering to host surfaces in the presence of a fluid flow. We show in this work that helix-like pili have the ability to act as efficient dampers of force that can, for a limited time, lower the load on the force-mediating adhesin-receptor bond on the tip of an individual pilus. The model presented is applied to bacteria adhering with a single pilus of either of the two most common types expressed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli, P or type 1 pili, subjected to realistic flows. The results indicate that for moderate flows ({\~{}}25 mm/s) the force experienced by the adhesin-receptor interaction at the tip of the pilus can be reduced by a factor of {\~{}}6 and {\~{}}4, respectively. The uncoiling ability provides a bacterium with a "go with the flow" possibility that acts as a damping. It is surmised that this can be an important factor for the initial part of the adhesion process, in particular in turbulent flows, and thereby be of use for bacteria in their striving to survive a natural defense such as fluid rinsing actions.},

P pili, whose main part constitutes the PapA rod, composed of approximately 10(3) PapA subunits in a helical arrangement, are distributed over the bacterial surface and mediate adhesion to host cells. They are particularly important in the pathogenesis of E. coli colonizing the upper urinary tract and kidneys. A biological model system has been established for in situ measurements of the forces that occur during mechanical stretching of pili. A mathematical model of the force-versus-elongation behavior of an individual pilus has been developed. Three elongation regions of pili were identified. In region I, P pili stretch elastically, up to a relative elongation of 16 +/- 3{\%}. The product of elasticity modulus and area of a P pilus, EA, was assessed to 154 +/- 20 pN (n=6). In region II, the quaternary structure of the PapA rod unfolds under a constant force of 27 +/- 2 pN (n approximately 100) by a sequential breaking of the interactions between adjacent layers of PapA subunits. This unfolding can elongate the pilus up to 7 +/- 2 times. In region III, pili elongate in a nonlinear manner as a result of stretching until the bond ruptures.},

The demonstration that high intravesical pressure is reflected to the kidney not only when the ureteric orifice is incompetent, but also during high diuresis, established the necessity for low pressures in neobladders.

We elucidate atomic structures of an ETEC major pilin subunit, CfaB, from colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) fimbriae. These data are used to construct models for 2 morphological forms of CFA/I fimbriae that are both observed in vivo: the helical filament into which it is typically assembled, and an extended, unwound conformation. Modeling and corroborative mutational data indicate that proline isomerization is involved in the conversion between these helical and extended forms. Our findings affirm the strong structural similarities seen between class 5 fimbriae (from bacteria primarily causing gastrointestinal disease) and class 1 pili (from bacteria that cause urinary, respiratory, and other infections) in the absence of significant primary sequence similarity. They also suggest that morphological and biochemical differences between fimbrial types, regardless of class, provide structural specialization that facilitates survival of each bacterial pathotype in its preferred host microenvironment. Last, we present structural evidence for bacterial use of antigenic variation to evade host immune responses, in that residues occupying the predicted surface-exposed face of CfaB and related class 5 pilins show much higher genetic sequence variability than the remainder of the pilin protein.},

abstract = {Abstract – Urinary system concerns with the excretion of urine, and the waste products of metabolism. The kidneys separate urea, mineral salts, toxins, and other waste products from the blood, and to conserve water, salts, and electrolytes. At least one kidney must function properly for life to be maintained. Each kidney contains 1.2 million filtering units called nephrons. After filtration, blood leaving the glomerulus flows through the network of capillaries that surrounds each tubule; water and certain salts, are restored to the blood. The purified blood returns to the renal vein. Urine from the kidney pelvis passes into the ureters. Muscles in the walls of the ureters send the urine in small spurts into the bladder, for temporary storage of urine. A full bladder stimulates sensory nerves in the bladder wall that relax the sphincter and allow release of the urine. The released urine enters the urethra, a tube lined with mucus membrane that conveys the urine to the outside. The male urethra terminates at the tip of the penis. The female urethra is less than 5 cm long and opens just in front of the entrance to the vagina. The urinary system disorders are: Congenital malformation, injury, infection, presence of kidney stones, or calculi, other types of obstruction, and tumors, cystitis, nephritis, nephrosis.},

Steered molecular dynamics simulations of tertiary structure of the FimH receptor binding domain and subsequent site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that shear-enhancement of the FimH-receptor interactions involves extension of the interdomain linker chain under mechanical force.

abstract = {Particle transfer in the wall region of turbulent boundary layers is dominated by the coherent structures which control the turbulence regeneration cycle. Coherent structures bring particles toward and away from the wall and favour particle segregation in the viscous region, giving rise to non-uniform particle. distribution profiles which peak close to the wall. The object of this work is to understand the reasons for higher particle concentration in the wall region by examining turbulent transfer of heavy particles to and away from the wall in connection with the coherent structures of the boundary layer. We will examine the behaviour of a dilute dispersion of heavy particles - flyashes in air - in a vertical channel flow, using pseudo-spectral direct numerical simulation to calculate the turbulent flow field at a shear Reynolds number Re-tau = 150, and Lagrangian tracking to describe the dynamics of particles. Drag force, gravity and Saffman lift are used in the equation of motion for the particles, which are assumed to have no influence on the flow field. Particle interaction with the wall is fully elastic. As reported in several previous investigations, we found that particles are transferred by sweeps - Q2 type events - in the wall region, where they preferentially accumulate in the low-speed streak environments, whereas ejections - Q4 type events - transfer particles from the wall region to the outer flow. We quantify the efficiency of the instantaneous realizations of the Reynolds stresses events in transferring different size particles to the wall and away from the wall, respectively. Our findings confirm that sweeps and ejections are efficient transfer mechanisms for particles. In particular, we find that only those sweep and ejection events with substantial spatial coherence are effective in transferring particles. However, the efficiency of the transfer mechanisms is conditioned by the presence of particles to be transferred. In the case of ejections, particles are more rarely available since, when in the viscous wall layer, they are concentrated under the low-speed streaks. Even though the low-speed streaks are ejection-like environments, particles remain trapped for a long time. This phenomenon, which causes accumulation of particles in the near-wall region, can be interpreted in terms of overall fluxes toward and away from the wall by the theory of turbophoresis. This theory, proposed initially by Caporaloni et al. (1975) and re-examined later by Reeks (1983), can help to explain the existence of net particle fluxes toward the wall as a manifestation of the skewness in the velocity distribution of the particles (Reeks 1983). To understand the local and instantaneous mechanisms which give rise to the phenomenon of turbophoresis, we focus on the near-wall region of the turbulent boundary layer. We examine the role of the rear-end of a quasistreamwise vortex very near to the wall in preventing particles in the proximity of the wall from being re-entrained by the pumping action of the large, farther from the wall, forward-end of a following quasi-streamwise vortex. We examine several mechanisms for turbulence structures near the wall and we find that the mechanism based on the archetypal quasi-streamwise structures identified by Schoppa {\&} Hussain (1997), the parent-offspring regeneration cycle for near-wall quasi-streamwise vortices discussed by Brooke {\&} Hanratty (1993), and the mechanism based on coherent packets of hairpin vortices, the fundamental super-structure characterized by Adrian, Meinhart {\&} Tomkins (2000), all depict the same characteristic pattern whic},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that bacteria are washed off surfaces as fluid flow increases because they adhere through 'slip-bonds' that weaken under mechanical force. However, we show here that the opposite is true for Escherichia coli attachment to monomannose-coated surfaces via the type 1 fimbrial adhesive subunit, FimH. Raising the shear stress (within the physiologically relevant range) increased accumulation of type 1 fimbriated bacteria on monomannose surfaces by up to two orders of magnitude, and reducing the shear stress caused them to detach. In contrast, bacterial binding to anti-FimH antibody-coated surfaces showed essentially the opposite behaviour, detaching when the shear stress was increased. These results can be explained if FimH is force-activated; that is, that FimH mediates 'catch-bonds' with mannose that are strengthened by tensile mechanical force. As a result, on monomannose-coated surfaces, bacteria displayed a complex 'stick-and-roll' adhesion in which they tended to roll over the surface at low shear but increasingly halted to stick firmly as the shear was increased. Mutations in FimH that were predicted earlier to increase or decrease force-induced conformational changes in FimH were furthermore shown here to increase or decrease the probability that bacteria exhibited the stationary versus the rolling mode of adhesion. This 'stick-and-roll' adhesion could allow type 1 fimbriated bacteria to move along mannosylated surfaces under relatively low flow conditions and to accumulate preferentially in high shear regions.},

abstract = {Surface organelles (so-called pili) expressed on the bacterial membrane mediate the adhesion of Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infection. These pili possess some extraordinary elongation properties that are assumed to allow a close bacterium-to-host contact even in the presence of shear forces caused by urine flow. The elongation properties of P pili have therefore been assessed for low elongation speeds (steady-state conditions). This work reports on the behavior of P pili probed by dynamic force spectroscopy. A kinetic model for the unfolding of a helixlike chain structure is derived and verified. It is shown that the unfolding of the quaternary structure of the PapA rod takes place at a constant force that is almost independent of elongation speed for slow elongations (up to approximately 0.4 mum/s), whereas it shows a dynamic response with a logarithmic dependence for fast elongations. The results provide information about the energy landscape and reaction rates. The bond length and thermal bond opening and closure rates for the layer-to-layer bond have been assessed to approximately 0.76 nm, approximately 0.8 Hz, and approximately 8 GHz, respectively. The results also support a previously constructed sticky-chain model for elongation of the PapA rod that until now had been experimentally verified only under steady-state conditions.},

abstract = {The Escherichia coli fimbrial adhesive protein, FimH, mediates shear-dependent binding to mannosylated surfaces via force-enhanced allosteric catch bonds, but the underlying structural mechanism was previously unknown. Here we present the crystal structure of FimH incorporated into the multiprotein fimbrial tip, where the anchoring (pilin) domain of FimH interacts with the mannose-binding (lectin) domain and causes a twist in the beta sandwich fold of the latter. This loosens the mannose-binding pocket on the opposite end of the lectin domain, resulting in an inactive low-affinity state of the adhesin. The autoinhibition effect of the pilin domain is removed by application of tensile force across the bond, which separates the domains and causes the lectin domain to untwist and clamp tightly around the ligand like a finger-trap toy. Thus, beta sandwich domains, which are common in multidomain proteins exposed to tensile force in vivo, can undergo drastic allosteric changes and be subjected to mechanical regulation.},

abstract = {The guinea pig ileum responds to distension with characteristic wall movements, luminal pressure gradients, and outflow (the peristaltic reflex). To date, little is known about whether the peristaltic reflex generates flow events other than laminar flow. Here we used a numerical method to solve for the flow generated by moving walls to assess occlusive contractions (case 1), nonocclusive contractions (case 2), and contractions with steep shoulders (case 3) for which visual parameters of wall movements are published. We found that all three contraction cases produced pressure differentials across the coapting segment, downstream and reverse flow, and vortical flow patterns that redistributed particles and mixed liquids. Contractions generated pressures and shear stresses, particularly along the moving section of the wall. The nonocclusive contraction was much less effective than the occlusive contraction with the steep shoulders; the occlusive contraction with flat shoulders had an intermediate effect. Our analysis shows that even peristaltic contractions produce not only laminar flow but also many flow events likely to promote digestion and absorption. The visual patterns of contractions impact the patterns of luminal flow, and precise definition of wall movements is critical to quantify the fluid mechanical consequences of intestinal contractions.},

abstract = {Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) express various kinds of organelles, so-called pili or fimbriae, that mediate adhesion to host tissue in the urinary tract through specific receptor-adhesin interactions. The biomechanical properties of these pili have been considered important for the ability of bacteria to withstand shear forces from rinsing urine flows. Force-measuring optical tweezers have been used to characterize individual organelles of F1C type expressed by UPEC bacteria with respect to such properties. Qualitatively, the force-versus-elongation response was found to be similar to that of other types of helix-like pili expressed by UPEC, i.e., type 1, P, and S, with force-induced elongation in three regions, one of which represents the important uncoiling mechanism of the helix-like quaternary structure. Quantitatively, the steady-state uncoiling force was assessed as 26.4 ±1.4 pN, which is similar to those of other pili (which range from 21 pN for S(I) to 30 pN for type 1). The corner velocity for dynamic response (1,400 nm/s) was found to be larger than those of the other pili (400-700 nm/s for S and P pili, and 6 nm/s for type 1). The kinetics were found to be faster, with a thermal opening rate of 17 Hz, a few times higher than S and P pili, and three orders of magnitude higher than type 1. These data suggest that F1C pili are, like P and S pili, evolutionarily selected to primarily withstand the conditions expressed in the upper urinary tract.},

abstract = {Rare negative streamwise velocities and extreme wall-normal velocity fluctuations near the wall are investigated for turbulent channel flow at a series of Reynolds numbers based on friction velocity up to Re-tau = 1000. Probability density functions of the wall-shear stress and velocity components are presented as well as joint probability density functions of the velocity components and the pressure. Backflow occurs more often (0.06{\%} at the wall at Re-tau = 1000) and further away (up to y(+) = 8.5) from the wall for increasing Reynolds number. The regions of backflow are circular with an average diameter, based on ensemble averages, of approximately 20 viscous units independent of Reynolds number. A strong oblique vortex outside the viscous sublayer is found to cause this backflow. Extreme wall-normal velocity events occur also more often for increasing Reynolds number. These extreme fluctuations cause high flatness values near the wall (F(v) = 43 at Re-tau = 1000). Positive and negative velocity spikes appear in pairs, located on the two edges of a strong streamwise vortex as documented by Xu et al. [Phys. Fluids 8, 1938 (1996)] for Re-tau = 180. The spikes are elliptical and orientated in streamwise direction with a typical length of 25 and a typical width of 7.5 viscous units at y(+) approximate to 1. The negative spike occurs in a high-speed streak indicating a sweeping motion, while the positive spike is located in between a high and low-speed streak. The joint probability density functions of negative streamwise and extreme wall-normal velocity events show that these events are largely uncorrelated. The majority of both type of events can be found lying underneath a large-scale structure in the outer region with positive sign, which can be understood by considering the more intense velocity fluctuations due to amplitude modulation of the inner layer by the outer layer. Simulations performed at different resolutions give only minor differences. Results from experiments and recent turbulent boundary layer simulations show similar results indicating that these rare events are universal for wall-bounded flows. In order to detect these rare events in experiments, measurement techniques have to be specifically tuned. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.3696304]},

abstract = {Recently, there has been a number of experimental studies convincingly demonstrating that a suspension of self-propelled bacteria (microswimmers in general) may have an effective viscosity significantly smaller than the viscosity of the ambient fluid. This is in sharp contrast with suspensions of hard passive inclusions, whose presence always increases the viscosity. Here we present a 2D model for a suspension of microswimmers in a fluid and analyze it analytically in the dilute regime (no swimmer-swimmer interactions) and numerically using a Mimetic Finite Difference discretization. Our analysis shows that in the dilute regime (in the absence of rotational diffusion) the effective shear viscosity is not affected by self-propulsion. But at the moderate concentrations (due to swimmer-swimmer interactions) the effective viscosity decreases linearly as a function of the propulsion strength of the swimmers. These findings prove that (i) a physically observable decrease of viscosity for a suspension of self-propelled microswimmers can be explained purely by hydrodynamic interactions and (ii) self-propulsion and interaction of swimmers are both essential to the reduction of the effective shear viscosity. We also performed a number of numerical experiments analyzing the dynamics of swimmers resulting from pairwise interactions. The numerical results agree with the physically observed phenomena (e.g., attraction of swimmer to swimmer and swimmer to the wall). This is viewed as an additional validation of the model and the numerical scheme.},

Operationally, it is possible to identify three morphologically distinct states of the 68-A-diameter P-pili rods, based on the degree of curvature each can adopt. These states are designated "straight," "curved," and "highly curved." The rods can also be unwound to form thin "threads" that are very similar to the tip fibrillae. Electron microscope data are used to distinguish among these four morphological states and to define limits on the shapes of the pilus proteins. The mechanical properties of the PapA polymers are assessed, and implications of rod polymorphism for pilus function are discussed. A wide variety of data are considered in light of the possibility that all pilins are similar in molecular architecture, with specific differences designed to optimize their specialized functions in the pilus assembly.},

abstract = {A novel, non-invasive method to diagnose bladder outlet obstruction involves the recording of noise with a contact microphone pressed against the perineum (between anus and scrotum). This noise results from flow-generated vortices caused by prostatic obstruction. We developed a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) urethral model including urethral geometry to study the relation between generated noise and the degree of obstruction. This model comprised a bladder, bladder neck, prostate and urethra. Calculations were carried out at four bladder pressures, five degrees of obstruction and three obstruction shapes. For each of the sixty simulations, the velocity and pressure distributions along the urethra were calculated including wall shear stresses to localize flow transition from disturbed to normal. Negative pressures at the obstruction outlet induced recirculation of flow. The location of transition was independent of the applied bladder pressure, but it depended primarily on the degree and secondarily on the shape of the obstruction. Based on the presented results, we hypothesize that the location of the maximum amplitude of perineal noise mainly depends on the degree and shape of the prostatic obstruction. Our future aim is to test our hypothesis in male patients and to extend the presented model to 3D with a viscoelastic urethral wall to calculate the fluid-wall interaction.},

abstract = {S pili are members of the chaperone-usher-pathway-assembled pili family that are predominantly associated with neonatal meningitis (S(II)) and believed to play a role in ascending urinary tract infections (S(I)). We used force-measuring optical tweezers to characterize the intrinsic biomechanical properties and kinetics of S(II) and S(I) pili. Under steady-state conditions, a sequential unfolding of the layers in the helix-like rod occurred at somewhat different forces, 26 pN for S(II) pili and 21 pN for S(I) pili, and there was an apparent difference in the kinetics, 1.3 and 8.8 Hz. Tests with bacteria defective in a newly recognized sfa gene (sfaX (II)) indicated that absence of the sfaX (II) gene weakens the interactions of the fimbrium slightly and decreases the kinetics. Data of S(I) are compared with those of previously assessed pili primary associated with urinary tract infections, the P and type 1 pili. S pili have weaker layer-to-layer bonds than both P and type 1 pili, 21, 28 and 30 pN, respectively. In addition, the S pili kinetics are {\~{}}10 times faster than the kinetics of P pili and {\~{}}550 times faster than the kinetics of type 1 pili. Our results also show that the biomechanical properties of pili expressed ectopically from a plasmid in a laboratory strain (HB101) and pili expressed from the chromosome of a clinical isolate (IHE3034) are identical. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish, by analyzing force-extension data, the different types of pili expressed by an individual cell of a clinical bacterial isolate.},

Virulence factors of recognized importance in the pathogenesis of urinary tract infection (UTI) include adhesins (P fimbriae, certain other mannose-resistant adhesins, and type 1 fimbriae), the aerobactin system, hemolysin, K capsule, and resistance to serum killing. This review summarizes the virtual explosion of information regarding the epidemiology, biochemistry, mechanisms of action, and genetic basis of these urovirulence factors that has occurred in the past decade and identifies areas in need of further study. Virulence factor expression is more common among certain genetically related groups of E. coli which constitute virulent clones within the larger E. coli population. In general, the more virulence factors a strain expresses, the more severe an infection it is able to cause. Certain virulence factors specifically favor the development of pyelonephritis, others favor cystitis, and others favor asymptomatic bacteriuria. The currently defined virulence factors clearly contribute to the virulence of wild-type strains but are usually insufficient in themselves to transform an avirulent organism into a pathogen, demonstrating that other as-yet-undefined virulence properties await discovery. Virulence factor testing is a useful epidemiological and research tool but as yet has no defined clinical role. Immunological and biochemical anti-virulence factor interventions are effective in animal models of UTI and hold promise for the prevention of UTI in humans.},

abstract = {The bacterial adhesive protein, FimH, is the most common adhesin of Escherichia coli and mediates weak adhesion at low flow but strong adhesion at high flow. There is evidence that this occurs because FimH forms catch bonds, defined as bonds that are strengthened by tensile mechanical force. Here, we applied force to single isolated FimH bonds with an atomic force microscope in order to test this directly. If force was loaded slowly, most of the bonds broke up at low force (<60 piconewtons of rupture force). However, when force was loaded rapidly, all bonds survived until much higher force (140-180 piconewtons of rupture force), behavior that indicates a catch bond. Structural mutations or pretreatment with a monoclonal antibody, both of which allosterically stabilize a high affinity conformation of FimH, cause all bonds to survive until high forces regardless of the rate at which force is applied. Pretreatment of FimH bonds with intermediate force has the same strengthening effect on the bonds. This demonstrates that FimH forms catch bonds and that tensile force induces an allosteric switch to the high affinity, strong binding conformation of the adhesin. The catch bond behavior of FimH, the amount of force needed to regulate FimH, and the allosteric mechanism all provide insight into how bacteria bind and form biofilms in fluid flow. Additionally, these observations may provide a means for designing antiadhesive mechanisms.},

abstract = {Optical tweezers are widely used to measure molecular forces in biology. Such measurements are often influenced by a nearby surface that can perturb both the calibration of the tweezers as well as the hydrodynamic forces acting on microspheres to which the biomolecules are attached. In this study, we have used a very stable optical tweezers setup employing a recently developed calibration method (Toli{\'{c}}-N{\o}rrelykke, S. F.; Sch{\"{a}}ffer, E.; Howard, J.; Pavone, F. S.; J{\"{u}}licher, F.; Flyvbjerg, H. Rev. Sci. Instrum. 2006, 77 (10), 103101) to determine how the calibration of the tweezers and the forces on the microspheres depend on the height above the surface. We show that the displacement sensitivity of the tweezers is modulated by a standing light wave between the microsphere and the surface. We measured the dependence of the drag coefficient on height and compared it to exact and closed-form solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. Also, we measured the surface force gradients in different salt solutions and for different surface blocking methods. For a given blocking method, our data suggest that microspheres can experience attractive and/or repulsive forces close to surfaces. For example, a Teflon layer reduces attractive interactions, and the presence of casein can lead to long-range repulsive interactions. These measurements are a prerequisite for the accurate measurement of normal forces with respect to an interface that occur in biological molecules held between surfaces.},

abstract = {Bacterial adhesion to surfaces mediated by specific adhesion organelles that promote infections, as exemplified by the pili of uropathogenic E. coli, is studied mostly at the level of cell-cell interactions and thereby reflects the averaged behavior of multiple pili. The role of pilus rod structure has therefore only been estimated from the outcome of experiments involving large numbers of organelles at the same time. It has, however, lately become clear that the biomechanical behavior of the pilus shafts play an important, albeit hitherto rather unrecognized, role in the adhesion process. For example, it has been observed that shafts from two different strains, even though they are similar in structure, result in large differences in the ability of the bacteria to adhere to their host tissue. However, in order to identify all properties of pilus structures that are of importance in the adhesion process, the biomechanical properties of pili must be assessed at the single-molecule level. Due to the low range of forces of these structures, until recently it was not possible to obtain such information. However, with the development of force-measuring optical tweezers (FMOT) with force resolution in the low piconewton range, it has lately become possible to assess forces mediated by individual pili on single living bacteria in real time. FMOT allows for a more or less detailed mapping of the biomechanical properties of individual pilus shafts, in particular those that are associated with their elongation and contraction under stress. This Mi- nireview presents the FMOT technique, the biological model system, and results from assessment of the biomechanical properties of bacterial pili. The information retrieved is also compared with that obtained by atomic force microscopy.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli exhibit both shear-stabilized rolling and a transition to stationary adhesion while adhering in fluid flow. Understanding the mechanism by which this shear-enhanced adhesion occurs is an important step in understanding bacterial pathogenesis. In this work, simulations are used to investigate the relative contributions of fimbrial deformation and bond transitions to the rolling and stationary adhesion of E. coli. Each E. coli body is surrounded by many long, thin fimbriae terminating in a single FimH receptor that is capable of forming a catch bond with mannose. As simulated cells progress along a mannosylated surface under flow, the fimbriae bend and buckle as they interact with the surface, and FimH-mannose bonds form and break according to a two-state, allosteric catch-bond model. In simulations, shear-stabilized rolling resulted from an increase in the low-affinity bond number due to increased fimbrial deformation with shear. Catch-bond formation did not occur during cell rolling, but instead led to the transition to stationary adhesion. In contrast, in leukocyte and platelet systems, catch bonds appear to be involved in the stabilization of rolling, and integrin activation is required for stationary adhesion.},

abstract = {We determined whether the molecular structures through which force is applied to receptor-ligand pairs are tuned to optimize cell adhesion under flow. The adhesive tethers of our model system, Escherichia coli, are type I fimbriae, which are anchored to the outer membrane of most E. coli strains. They consist of a fimbrial rod (0.3-1.5 microm in length) built from a helically coiled structural subunit, FimA, and an adhesive subunit, FimH, incorporated at the fimbrial tip. Previously reported data suggest that FimH binds to mannosylated ligands on the surfaces of host cells via catch bonds that are enhanced by the shear-originated tensile force. To understand whether the mechanical properties of the fimbrial rod regulate the stability of the FimH-mannose bond, we pulled the fimbriae via a mannosylated tip of an atomic force microscope. Individual fimbriae rapidly elongate for up to 10 microm at forces above 60 pN and rapidly contract again at forces below 25 pN. At intermediate forces, fimbriae change length more slowly, and discrete 5.0 +/- 0.3-nm changes in length can be observed, consistent with uncoiling and coiling of the helical quaternary structure of one FimA subunit at a time. The force range at which fimbriae are relatively stable in length is the same as the optimal force range at which FimH-mannose bonds are longest lived. Higher or lower forces, which cause shorter bond lifetimes, cause rapid length changes in the fimbria that help maintain force at the optimal range for sustaining the FimH-mannose interaction. The modulation of force and the rate at which it is transmitted from the bacterial cell to the adhesive catch bond present a novel physiological role for the fimbrial rod in bacterial host cell adhesion. This suggests that the mechanical properties of the fimbrial shaft have codeveloped to optimize the stability of the terminal adhesive under flow.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the catch bond mechanism, where binding becomes stronger under tensile force, is a common property among non-covalent interactions between biological molecules that are exposed to mechanical force in vivo. Here, by using the multi-protein tip complex of the mannose-binding type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli, we show how the entire quaternary structure of the adhesive organella is adapted to facilitate binding under mechanically dynamic conditions induced by flow. The fimbrial tip mediates shear-dependent adhesion of bacteria to uroepithelial cells and demonstrates force-enhanced interaction with mannose in single molecule force spectroscopy experiments. The mannose-binding, lectin domain of the apex-positioned adhesive protein FimH is docked to the anchoring pilin domain in a distinct hooked manner. The hooked conformation is highly stable in molecular dynamics simulations under no force conditions but permits an easy separation of the domains upon application of an external tensile force, allowing the lectin domain to switch from a low- to a high-affinity state. The conformation between the FimH pilin domain and the following FimG subunit of the tip is open and stable even when tensile force is applied, providing an extended lever arm for the hook unhinging under shear. Finally, the conformation between FimG and FimF subunits is highly flexible even in the absence of tensile force, conferring to the FimH adhesin an exploratory function and high binding rates. The fimbrial tip of type 1 Escherichia coli is optimized to have a dual functionality: flexible exploration and force sensing. Comparison to other structures suggests that this property is common in unrelated bacterial and eukaryotic adhesive complexes that must function in dynamic conditions.},

abstract = {The dynamics of pyeloureteral flow is described when there is no peristalsis and for peristalsis of high and intermediate frequencies, on the assumption that the ureter is uniform except in the mid-ureter and at the outlet. The possibility of upstream transmission of bladder pressure variations to the renal pelvis is considered. The overall behaviour depends on three principal variables, the maximum tube pressure in the contraction waves, the intrinsic peristaltic carrying capacity and the peristaltic frequency f, expressed in the form fT where T is the time for a peristaltic contraction wave to sweep through the ureter. At intermediate peristaltic frequencies (fT less than but comparable with one) oscillatory flow patterns can occur, in which periods of peristaltically driven flow alternate with extraperistaltic periods of flow through the open ureter. The kidney is better isolated from bladder pressure variations when the peristaltic frequency is high, but high peristaltic frequency can by itself lead to elevated renal pelvic pressure if the flow rate is high. Experimental observations in pigs are presented to support these conclusions.},

abstract = {In the intestine, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli works against peristaltic forces, adhering to the epithelium via the colonization factor antigen I (CFA/I) fimbrial adhesin CfaE. The CfaE adhesin is similar in localization and tertiary (but not primary) structure to FimH, the type 1 fimbrial adhesin of uropathogenic E. coli, which shows shear-dependent binding to epithelial receptors by an allosteric catch-bond mechanism. Thus, we speculated that CfaE is also capable of shear-enhanced binding. Indeed, bovine erythrocytes coursing over immobilized CFA/I fimbriae in flow chambers exhibited low accumulation levels and fast rolling at low shear, but an 80-fold increase in accumulation and threefold decrease in rolling velocity at elevated shear. This effect was reversible and abolished by pre-incubation of fimbriae with anti-CfaE antibody. Erythrocytes bound to whole CfaE in the same shear-enhanced manner, but to CfaE adhesin domain in a shear-inhibitable fashion. Residue replacements designed to disrupt CfaE interdomain interaction decreased the shear dependency of adhesion and increased binding under static conditions to human intestinal epithelial cells. These findings indicate that close interaction between adhesive and anchoring pilin domains of CfaE keeps the former in a low-affinity state that toggles into a high-affinity state upon separation of two domains, all consistent with an allosteric catch-bond mechanism of CfaE binding.},

abstract = {Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are a major cause of diarrheal disease worldwide. Adhesion pili (or fimbriae), such as the CFA/I (colonization factor antigen I) organelles that enable ETEC to attach efficiently to the host intestinal tract epithelium, are critical virulence factors for initiation of infection. We characterized the intrinsic biomechanical properties and kinetics of individual CFA/I pili at the single-organelle level, demonstrating that weak external forces (7.5 pN) are sufficient to unwind the intact helical filament of this prototypical ETEC pilus and that it quickly regains its original structure when the force is removed. While the general relationship between exertion of force and an increase in the filament length for CFA/I pili associated with diarrheal disease is analogous to that of P pili and type 1 pili, associated with urinary tract and other infections, the biomechanical properties of these different pili differ in key quantitative details. Unique features of CFA/I pili, including the significantly lower force required for unwinding, the higher extension speed at which the pili enter a dynamic range of unwinding, and the appearance of sudden force drops during unwinding, can be attributed to morphological features of CFA/I pili including weak layer-to-layer interactions between subunits on adjacent turns of the helix and the approximately horizontal orientation of pilin subunits with respect to the filament axis. Our results indicate that ETEC CFA/I pili are flexible organelles optimized to withstand harsh motion without breaking, resulting in continued attachment to the intestinal epithelium by the pathogenic bacteria that express these pili.},

abstract = {High shear enhances the adhesion of Escherichia coli bacteria binding to mannose coated surfaces via the adhesin FimH, raising the question as to whether FimH forms catch bonds that are stronger under tensile mechanical force. Here, we study the length of time that E. coli pause on mannosylated surfaces and report a double exponential decay in the duration of the pauses. This double exponential decay is unlike previous single molecule or whole cell data for other catch bonds, and indicates the existence of two distinct conformational states. We present a mathematical model, derived from the common notion of chemical allostery, which describes the lifetime of a catch bond in which mechanical force regulates the transitions between two conformational states that have different unbinding rates. The model explains these characteristics of the data: a double exponential decay, an increase in both the likelihood and lifetime of the high-binding state with shear stress, and a biphasic effect of force on detachment rates. The model parameters estimated from the data are consistent with the force-induced structural changes shown earlier in FimH. This strongly suggests that FimH forms allosteric catch bonds. The model advances our understanding of both catch bonds and the role of allostery in regulating protein activity.},

abstract = {Ureteral peristaltic mechanism facilitates urine transport from the kidney to the bladder. Numerical analysis of the peristaltic flow in the ureter aims to further our understanding of the reflux phenomenon and other ureteral abnormalities. Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) plays an important role in accuracy of this approach and the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) formulation is a strong method to analyze the coupled fluid-structure interaction between the compliant wall and the surrounding fluid. This formulation, however, was not used in previous studies of peristalsis in living organisms. In the present investigation, a numerical simulation is introduced and solved through ALE formulation to perform the ureteral flow and stress analysis. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are used as the governing equations for the fluid, and a linear elastic model is utilized for the compliant wall. The wall stimulation is modeled by nonlinear contact analysis using a rigid contact surface since an appropriate model for simulation of ureteral peristalsis needs to contain cell-to-cell wall stimulation. In contrast to previous studies, the wall displacements are not predetermined in the presented model of this finite-length compliant tube, neither the peristalsis needs to be periodic. Moreover, the temporal changes of ureteral wall intraluminal shear stress during peristalsis are included in our study. Iterative computing of two-way coupling is used to solve the governing equations. Two phases of nonperistaltic and peristaltic transport of urine in the ureter are discussed. Results are obtained following an analysis of the effects of the ureteral wall compliance, the pressure difference between the ureteral inlet and outlet, the maximum height of the contraction wave, the contraction wave velocity, and the number of contraction waves on the ureteral outlet flow. The results indicate that the proximal part of the ureter is prone to a higher shear stress during peristalsis compared with its middle and distal parts. It is also shown that the peristalsis is more efficient as the maximum height of the contraction wave increases. Finally, it is concluded that improper function of ureteropelvic junction results in the passage of part of urine back flow even in the case of slow start-up of the peristaltic contraction wave.},

abstract = {Type 1 fimbriae mediate adhesion of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to host cells. It has been hypothesized that due to their ability to uncoil under exposure to force, fimbriae can reduce fluid shear stress on the adhesin-receptor interaction by which the bacterium adheres to the surface. In this work, we develop a model that describes how the force on the adhesin-receptor interaction of a type 1 fimbria varies as a bacterium is affected by a time-dependent fluid flow mimicking in vivo conditions. The model combines in vivo hydrodynamic conditions with previously assessed biomechanical properties of the fimbriae. Numerical methods are used to solve for the motion and adhesion force under the presence of time-dependent fluid profiles. It is found that a bacterium tethered with a type 1 pilus will experience significantly reduced shear stress for moderate to high flow velocities and that the maximum stress the adhesin will experience is limited to ∼120 pN, which is sufficient to activate the conformational change of the FimH adhesin into its stronger state but also lower than the force required for breaking it under rapid loading. Our model thus supports the assumption that the type 1 fimbria shaft and the FimH adhesin-receptor interaction are optimized to each other, and that they give piliated bacteria significant advantages in rapidly changing fluidic environments.},

abstract = {Although ubiquitous, the processes by which bacteria colonize surfaces remain poorly understood. Here we report results for the influence of the wall shear stress on the early-stage adhesion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 on glass and polydimethylsiloxane surfaces. We use image analysis to measure the residence time of each adhering bacterium under flow. Our main finding is that, on either surface, the characteristic residence time of bacteria increases approximately linearly as the shear stress increases (0-3.5 Pa). To investigate this phenomenon, we used mutant strains defective in surface organelles (type I pili, type IV pili, or the flagellum) or extracellular matrix production. Our results show that, although these bacterial surface features influence the frequency of adhesion events and the early-stage detachment probability, none of them is responsible for the trend in the shear-enhanced adhesion time. These observations bring what we believe are new insights into the mechanism of bacterial attachment in shear flows, and suggest a role for other intrinsic features of the cell surface, or a dynamic cell response to shear stress.},

abstract = {The progression of a natural bacterial infection is a dynamic process influenced by the physiological characteristics of the target organ. Recent developments in live animal imaging allow for the study of the dynamic microbe-host interplay in real-time as the infection progresses within an organ of a live host. Here we used multiphoton microscopy-based live animal imaging, combined with advanced surgical procedures, to investigate the role of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) attachment organelles P and Type 1 fimbriae in renal bacterial infection. A GFP+ expressing variant of UPEC strain CFT073 and genetically well-defined isogenic mutants were microinfused into rat glomerulus or proximal tubules. Within 2 h bacteria colonized along the flat squamous epithelium of the Bowman's capsule despite being exposed to the primary filtrate. When facing the challenge of the filtrate flow in the proximal tubule, the P and Type 1 fimbriae appeared to act in synergy to promote colonization. P fimbriae enhanced early colonization of the tubular epithelium, while Type 1 fimbriae mediated colonization of the center of the tubule via a mechanism believed to involve inter-bacterial binding and biofilm formation. The heterogeneous bacterial community within the tubule subsequently affected renal filtration leading to total obstruction of the nephron within 8 h. Our results reveal the importance of physiological factors such as filtration in determining bacterial colonization patterns, and demonstrate that the spatial resolution of an infectious niche can be as small as the center, or periphery, of a tubule lumen. Furthermore, our data show how secondary physiological injuries such as obstruction contribute to the full pathophysiology of pyelonephritis.},

We review how the physical properties of digesta change during transit through the various segments of the intestine, and how their influence on flow and mixing may be modulated by peristaltic activity. We examine how, in more fluid digesta, the solid and liquid phases interact to influence flow and mixing. Similarly, how in viscid digesta, shear strength, plasticity and elasticity of contained particulate material may influence the permeation of the fluid phase and secretions into and out of the digesta bolus. The manner in which the solid and liquid phases of digesta interact in a partly gaseous environment, such as the lower bowel, to influence bolus cohesion is also examined. Those mechanisms that promote the formation of a less viscous layer at the mucosal interface to promote plug flow are reviewed, and their effect on the efficiency of mixing and digestion discussed. It is recommended that in any future work investigating the character of mixing in the intestine, a wider range of appropriate digesta properties be measured and that, in investigations of intestinal movement, perfusates with similar characteristics to digesta be used.},

abstract = {P pili are protein filaments expressed by uropathogenic Escherichia coli that mediate binding to glycolipids on epithelial cell surfaces, which is a prerequisite for bacterial infection. When a bacterium, attached to a cell surface, is exposed to external forces, the pili, which are composed of approximately 10(3) PapA protein subunits arranged in a helical conformation, can elongate by unfolding to a linear conformation. This property is considered important for the ability of a bacterium to withstand shear forces caused by urine flow. It has hitherto been assumed that this elongation is plastic, thus constituting a permanent conformational deformation. We demonstrate, using optical tweezers, that this is not the case; the unfolding of the helical structure to a linear conformation is fully reversible. It is surmised that this reversibility helps the bacteria regain close contact to the host cells after exposure to significant shear forces, which is believed to facilitate their colonization.},

abstract = {Gram-negative bacteria often initiate their colonization by use of extended attachment organelles, so called pili. When exposed to force, the rod of helix-like pili has been found to be highly extendable, mainly attributed to uncoiling and recoiling of its quaternary structure. This provides the bacteria with the ability to redistribute an external force among a multitude of pili, which enables them to withstand strong rinsing flows, which, in turn, facilitates adherence and colonization processes critical to virulence. Thus, pili fibers are possible targets for novel antibacterial agents. By use of a substance that compromises compliance of the pili, the ability of bacteria to redistribute external forces can be impaired, so they will no longer be able to resist strong urine flow and thus be removed from the host. It is possible such a substance can serve as an alternative to existing antibiotics in the future or be a part of a multi-drug. In this work we investigated whether it is possible to achieve this by targeting the recoiling process. The test substance was purified PapD. The effect of PapD on the compliance of P pili was assessed at the single organelle level by use of force-measuring optical tweezers. We showed that the recoiling process, and thus the biomechanical compliance, in particular the recoiling process, can be impaired by the presence of PapD. This leads to a new concept in the search for novel drug candidates combating uropathogenic bacterial infections--"coilicides", targeting the subunits of which the pilus rod is composed.},

A standard LIBS calibration technique using peak area integration normalized by an internal standard was compared to peak area integration normalized by total light and the multivariate statistical technique of partial least squares. For the partial least squares analysis, the PLS-1 algorithm was used, where a predictive model is generated for each element separately. Partial least squares regression coefficients show that the algorithm correctly identifies the atomic emission peaks of interest for each of the elements. Predictive capabilities of each calibration approach were quantified by calculating the standard and relative errors of prediction. The performance of partial least squares is on par with using iron as an internal standard but has the key advantage that it can be applied to samples where the concentrations of all elements are unknown.},

abstract = {Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are etiological agents of cervical cancer. In order to address clinical demand for HPV detection and sequence typing, mostly in pre-cancerous cervical lesions, we applied our two-tier PCR-direct sequencing (PCR-DS) approach based on the use of both MY09/MY11 and GP5 + /GP6 + sets of primers. We tested 691 pathological specimens, all of which were biopsies, 75{\%} of which were diagnosed histologically as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grades I-III. In total, 484 samples (70{\%}) tested HPV-positive, yielding 531 HPV sequences from 47 HPV types, including two novel types. Four most frequently found HPV types accounted for 52.9{\%} of all isolates: HPV6, 16, 11, and 31 (21.5{\%}, 20.0{\%}, 7.0{\%}, and 4.5{\%}, respectively). Some interesting results are the following: all currently known high-risk HPV (14 types) and low-risk HPV (6 types) were detected; HPV18 was not the 1st or 2nd but rather the 4th-5th most frequent high-risk HPV type; the highest detection rate for HPV (86{\%}) among samples suspected to be HPV-infected was found in the youngest age group (0-10 years old), including 70{\%} (44/63) "genital" HPV types; HPV types of undetermined cervical cancer risk represented 19{\%} and of the total HPV isolates but were strongly increased in co-infections (36.5{\%} of all isolates). To our knowledge, this is the largest sequencing-based study of HPV. The HPV types of unknown cancer risk, representing the majority of the known HPV types, 27 of the 47 types detected in this study, are not likely to play a major role in cervical cancer because their prevalence in CIN-I, II, and III declines from 16{\%} to 8{\%} to 2.5{\%}. The two-tier PCR-DS method provides greater sensitivity than cycle sequencing using only one pair of primers.

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy was applied to test the possibility of detecting and identifying asbestos in different samples in view of the perspective at field operation without sample preparation which is peculiar to this technique. Several like-resin materials were first investigated by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy, in order to find an asbestos container assuring safe laboratory operation during the material characterization aimed to identify indicators suitable for a quick identification on field. Successively, spectra of asbestos samples of both in serpentine and amphibole forms were measured and the variability in elemental composition was calculated from the emission spectra. Ratios of intensities of characteristic elements were tested as indicators for asbestos recognition. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy results were compared with those obtained by analyzing the same asbestos samples with a scanning electron microscopy equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, a good correlation was found for Mg/Si and Fe/Si, thus showing the capability of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy as a diagnostic tool for this category of materials. In particular, it was demonstrated that the method based on two indicators derived from laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy intensity ratios allows to discriminate between asbestos and cements in single shot measurements suitable to field operation.},

abstract = {The feasibility of laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) as an online tool for trace metal analysis in terephthalic acid (TA) was evaluated. Millions of metric tonnes of TA are produced each year as a raw material for various kinds of polyesters used to make many consumer and industrial products. The conventional techniques used for trace metal analysis in TA are electrothermal atomization atomic absorption spectrometry (ETA-AAS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). However, these techniques require digestion of the sample and dissolution and so are very time consuming and are not suitable for online analysis. LIBS, if it meets the sensitivity and accuracy requirements, will be a very effective tool for online analysis of the production of terephthalic acid and other organic particles. In this work, the main elements of interest, including Mn, Co, Fe, and Na, were studied. The strongest emission line of each element was chosen to obtain the best detection limit. The experimental parameters, including delay time, gate time, sample stage moving speed, and laser repetition rate, were optimized to maximize the signal-to-noise and signal-to-background ratios. Two sampling methods were studied: compressed pellet and loose powder on sticky tape. The preliminary results indicated that there was no difference between these two sampling methods in term of sensitivity and precision. Therefore, the loose powder on sticky tape was preferred for making online analysis of loose powders possible. One unknown and two certified samples were used to determine the accuracy of the method, and the results were compared to those obtained by ICP-OES.},

Multivariate calibrations use the entire signal matrix for all elements in a single multivariate regression model. This enables accounting for the correlation between variables often referred to as matrix effects in conventional univariate modeling. Modeling the entire signal matrix improves robustness over traditional univariate calibration since it can compensate for matrix effects. Several nonlinear data pretreatment methods have been used to correct for nonlinear behaviors of the analytical signals prior to performing the multivariate calibration. The use of multivariate calibration in combination with cubic implicit nonlinear data pretreatment showed the most accurate results. The accuracy reported with the developed multivariate calibration is better than 5{\%} for the major alloying elements.

Four categories were histologically classified: control C57BL/6J, adenomatous, non-diseased regions of adenomatous, and non-diseased Apc(Min). OCT images were compared to histology. Spectra from the four categories were compared via the Student's t-test. RESULTS: Three Apc(Min) and two control mice completed the study. One adenoma was histologically identified; OCT visualized mucosal thickening/abnormal mass development over the imaging timepoints. LIF spectral comparisons revealed decreased 405 nm intensity and the presence of a peak at 680 nm in the adenomatous Apc(Min). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary data indicate endoscopic OCT-LIF has the potential to identify colorectal adenomas in murine models.},

In order to fingerprint these plastics, a laser-produced plasma emission was recorded for spectral analysis of various kinds of plastics. The plasma was generated by focusing a Nd:YAG laser radiation at wavelength = 1064 nm having laser energy = 40 mJ. The 6 main family of plastics tested are: Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE), High Density Polyethylene (HDPE), Polypropylenes (PP), Polystyrene (PS), Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) and Polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The capability of this technique is demonstrated by the analysis of the major constituents carbon and hydrogen present in polymer matrices. The LIBS signal intensity measured for carbon and hydrogen was detrimental for the fingerprinting of various kinds of plastics. The C/H line intensity ratio was 1.68, 1.51, 1.42, 1.16, 1.01 and 0.91 for HDPE, LDPE, PS, PP, PET and PVC respectively. The detection limits of carbon and hydrogen were found to be approximately 6 micro g/g by applying 20 laser shots. The unique features of LIBS are: it is a simple, rapid, remote, real-time analysis without sampling requirements. The study demonstrated that LIBS could be applied as a best tool for sorting out different kinds plastics on a fast scale for waste management. The health hazards of different kinds of plastics are also described.},

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been applied for the multi-elemental analysis of fertilizer. With a set of 11 fertilizer samples containing different levels of phosphorus and potassium, it was identified that the line intensity of the analyte does not follow a straightforward correlation with the element concentration with the presence of matrix effects. Instead, the line intensity of a given analyte element is not only related to that analyte, but also to other elements present in the samples. Further analysis reveals the correlations among the line intensities of the main components. Based on the correlation analysis, a set of calibration models were generated for phosphorus and potassium with the method of partial least squares (PLS) analysis, which is known as a multivariate calibration method. The prediction accuracy and reproducibility of these PLS models were then validated using independent LIBS measurements. The results show that the predicted concentrations with these models provided by LIBS measurements are in good agreement with the reference concentrations, which confirms that the LIBS technique has good potential for the in situ rapid determination of the main elements present in fertilizer.},

The characteristic line intensity of the specific element was taken to build up the dominant factor to reflect the major elemental concentration and partial least squares (PLS) approach was then applied to further improve the model accuracy. The deviation evolution of characteristic line intensity from the ideal condition was depicted and according to the deviation understanding, efforts were taken to model the non-linear self-absorption and inter-element interference effects to improve the accuracy of dominant factor model. With a dominant factor to carry the main quantitative information, the novel multivariate model combines advantages of both the conventional univariate and PLS models and partially avoids the overuse of the unrelated noise in the spectrum for PLS application. The dominant factor makes the combination model more robust over a wide concentration range and PLS application improves the model accuracy for samples with matrices within the calibration sample set. Results show that RMSEP of the final dominant factor based PLS model decreased to 2.33{\%} from 5.25{\%} when using the conventional PLS approach with full spectral information. Furthermore, with the development in understanding the physics of the laser-induced plasma, there is potential to easily improve the accuracy of the dominant factor model as well as the proposed novel multivariate model.},

abstract = {Thirty-three bituminous coal samples were utilized to test the application of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy technique for coal elemental concentration measurement in the air. The heterogeneity of the samples and the pyrolysis or combustion of coal during the laser-sample interaction processes were analyzed to be the main reason for large fluctuation of detected spectra and low calibration quality. Compared with the generally applied normalization with the whole spectral area, normalization with segmental spectral area was found to largely improve the measurement precision and accuracy. The concentrations of major element C in coal were determined by a novel partial least squares (PLS) model based on dominant factor. Dominant C concentration information was taken from the carbon characteristic line intensity since it contains the most-related information, even if not accurately. This dominant factor model was further improved by inducting non-linear relation by partially modeling the inter-element interference effect. The residuals were further corrected by PLS with the full spectrum information. With the physical-principle-based dominant factor to calculate the main quantitative information and to partially explicitly include the non-linear relation, the proposed PLS model avoids the overuse of unrelated noise to some extent and becomes more robust over a wider C concentration range. Results show that RMSEP in the proposed PLS model decreased to 4.47{\%} from 5.52{\%} for the conventional PLS with full spectrum input, while R(2) remained as high as 0.999, and RMSEC{\&}P was reduced from 3.60{\%} to 2.92{\%}, showing the overall improvement of the proposed PLS model.},

This emergent technique promises applications with expected outcomes in food security or nutrition quality, as well as environment pollution detection. Characterization of the plasma induced on such soft and humid materials represents the first step towards quantitative measurement using this technique. In this paper, we present the experimental setup and protocol that optimize the plasma generation on fresh vegetables, potatoes for instance. The temporal evolution of the plasma properties are investigated using time-resolved laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). In particular, the electron density and the temperatures of the plasma are reported as functions of its decay time. The temperatures are evaluated from the well known Boltzmann and Saha-Boltzmann plot methods. These temperatures are further compared to that of the typical molecular species, CN, for laser-induced plasma from plant materials. This comparison validates the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the specific case of fresh vegetables ablated in the typical LIBS conditions. A study of the temporal evolution of the signal to noise ratio also provides practical indications for an optimized detection of trace elements. We demonstrate finally that, under certain conditions, the calibration-free LIBS procedure can be applied to determine the concentrations of trace elements in fresh vegetables.},

Differences are noted in the Raman spectra for these two different wavelengths, which are attributed to resonance effects due to overlap of the 632.8 nm source with electronic absorption bands. In addition, significant laser intensity effects are found that result in laser-induced transformation of MoS2 to MoO3. Finally, the transformation to molybdenum trioxide is explored as a function of temperature and atmosphere, revealing an apparent transformation at 375 K in the presence of oxygen. Overall, Raman spectroscopy is an useful tool for tribological study of MoS2 coatings, including the role of molybdenum trioxide transformations, although careful attention must be given to the laser excitation parameters (both wavelength and intensity) when interpreting Raman spectra.},

A range of spectral data was recorded for double-pulse and singlepulse configurations, including both ns and fs prepulse widths, while varying the gas-phase mass percentage of the carbon from about 10{\%} to 90{\%} for various fixed carbon concentrations. The carbon emission response, as measured by the peak-to-continuum ratio, was greater for the double-pulse configuration as compared with the single-pulse response and was also enhanced as the percentage of solid-phase carbon was increased. Using a combination of the double-pulse and single-pulse emission signals, a monotonically increasing response function was found to correlate with the percentage of gas-phase analyte. However, individual data points at the measured gas-phase percentages reveal considerable scatter from the predicted trend. Furthermore, the double-pulse to single-pulse ratio was only pronounced with the ns–ns configuration as compared with the fs–ns scheme. Overall, the LIBS methodology has been demonstrated as a potential means to discriminate between gas-phase and particulatephase fractions of the same elemental species in an aerosol, although future optimization of the temporal parameters should be explored to improve the precision and accuracy of this approach. © 2010 Optical Society of America},

abstract = {Calibration-Free Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (CF-LIBS) has been proposed several years ago as an approach for quantitative analysis of Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy spectra. Recently developed refinement of the spectral processing method is described in the present work. Accurate quantitative results have been demonstrated for several metallic alloys. However, the degree of accuracy that can be achieved with Calibration-Free Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy analysis of generic samples still needs to be thoroughly investigated. The authors have undertaken a systematic study of errors and biasing factors affecting the calculation in the Calibration-Free Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy spectra processing. These factors may be classified in three main groups: 1) experimental aberrations (intensity fluctuations and inaccuracy in the correction for spectral efficiency of a detection system), 2) inaccuracy in theoretical parameters used for calculations (Stark broadening coefficients and partition functions) and 3) plasma non-ideality (departure from thermal equilibrium, spatial and temporal inhomogeneities, optical thickness, etc.). In this study, the effects of experimental aberrations and accuracy of spectral data were investigated, assuming that the analytical plasma is ideal. Departure of the plasma conditions from ideality will be the object of future work. The current study was based on numerical simulation. Two kinds of metallic alloys, iron-based and aluminum-based, were studied. The relative weight of the error contributions was found to depend on the sample composition. For the here-investigated samples, the experimental aberrations contribute to the overall uncertainty on the quantitative results more than theoretical parameters. The described simulation method can be applied to the Calibration-Free Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy analysis of any other kind of sample.},

A plasma plume is produced by focusing the third harmonic of a Nd: YAG laser ($\lambda$ = 355 nm) onto the glass melt surface at 1200 C, and the plasma emission is guided via optical fiber and is characterized by an echelle spectrometer for the spectral range from 200 to 780 nm with a resolution of 0.01 nm. Compared to a Czerny-Turner spectrometer, the echelle spectrometer appears distinctively superior for its broad operational spectral range and high resolution. The laser-induced plasma is found as optically thin and locally in thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) as characterized by measuring the electron density and plasma temperature. The matrix temperature effect on the spectral emission is observed as significant, increasing the emission line intensities with increasing temperature, but differently from element to element. The applicability of LIBS is demonstrated on a laboratory scale with an inactive simulated HLLW glass melt for various analytical characteristics concerned.},

Detection limits for Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, and Si in steel ranged from 0.11 to 0.24{\%} using a commercial polychromator-based detection system with limits 4-30 times lower achieved using a laboratory-based detection system. The minimum detectable masses of Ba, Cr, Mn, and Sr on a metal surface were estimated with 1.2 pg/shot achieved for Sr. Detection limits for Ba and Sr in soil were 296 and 52 ppm, respectively. The temperatures, spectra, and emission decay curves from plasmas generated by the AO- and EO-lasers are compared and some characteristics of particles ablated by the AO-laser are described.},

It is shown that this setup is sufficiently sensitive to both major (P, Mg) and minor elements (Na, Zn, Sr). The measured quantities of Mg, Zn, and Sr correspond to the values obtained by reference laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) measurements within an approximately 20{\%} range of uncertainty. A single point calibration was performed by use of a bone meal standard . The radial element distribution is almost invariable by use of LA-ICP-MS, whereas the LIBS measurement showed a strong dependence on the sample porosity.

Neural networks were then used for measuring chromium concentration in one of the soils. We performed a detailed optimization of the inputs of the network so as to improve its predictive performances and we studied the effect of the presence of matrix-specific information in the inputs examined. Finally the inputs of the network-the spectral intensities-were replaced by the line areas.

The precision of each approach was assessed using calibration curves, and the LA-LIBS configuration was demonstrated to consistently produce a superior analytical response, as assessed by the linear least-squares fit correlation coefficient and y-intercept values. Significantly, the normalized (by Fe) response of the four targeted analyte species (Al, Mn, Mg and Cu) was successfully reduced to a single calibration curve with the LA-LIBS approach. In addition, particle size measurements of the laser-ablation plume were recorded along with SEM and white-light interferometry analysis of ablation craters for assessment of the analytical sample as presented to the analytical LIBS plasma.

With the use of a 1-m focal length monochromator and an echelle spectrometer both equipped with an intensified charge coupled device (ICCD), the studies on the effect of the delay between the two laser pulses displayed optimum enhancements of line emissions only at 200 ns in the reheating scheme developed here. The experimental parameters, like the signal acquisition delay, were largely studied. The line intensity enhancements were also investigated in dependence on physical parameters, such as the excitation energy levels of the lines observed. Moreover, the relative importance of ionic and neutral lines in the emission spectra was precisely characterized. From the different investigations, the behaviors of the line emissions towards the double-pulse technique were related to their excitation energy levels. A correlation between the increases in intensity and the excitation energy levels of the line emissions was highlighted. As a result, the reheating scheme showed improvements of sensitivity for elements emitting ionic lines compared with the corresponding single-pulse experiments.},

abstract = {This paper illustrates the application of the well-known approach of duplicating the emission from a plasma by placing a spherical mirror behind it in order to characterize the degree of self-absorption of atomic transitions. It is shown that this simple expedient provides a quick check for the existence of optically thick plasma conditions, and allows one to follow the temporal evolution of the plasma optical depth from the early decay of the continuum emission to the end of the plasma lifetime. The method is applied to a plasma induced at atmospheric pressure by focusing an Nd:YAG laser on different Al-alloy targets. Moreover, if the resolution of the monochromator allows one to obtain the true physical profiles of the lines investigated, a self-absorption correction factor can be calculated, following a methodology described in the plasma diagnostic literature. It is shown that this correction can be used to improve the linearity of calibration curves and to identify outliers in the Saha-Boltzmann plot for temperature evaluation. The data obtained are still the result of line-of-sight measurements, and therefore can only be interpreted in terms of some space-averaged values of the parameters evaluated. Despite this limitation, it is argued that the simple addition of a mirror to a laser induced plasma emission experiment has many advantageous features and should find a more widespread use when performing laser induced breakdown spectroscopy experiments.},

Calibration curves are finally generated for each element of interest measured on certified samples with different provenience and matrix composition. In this paper a model is developed which takes into account the effects responsible for non-linearities in the relationship between line intensity and elemental concentration. The model properly includes line re-absorption and contributions from space regions with different plasma densities. Its application permits us to obtain the correlation coefficients between the LIBS measured and certified concentration of each element analyzed. These coefficients, specific for a given experimental layout and atomic lines data base, are successively applied in analytical LIBS measurements allowing for the direct determination of a single element concentration in any sample, regardless of its unknown matrix composition. The LIBS method presented here was tested on a priori unknown samples, and gave uncertainties in concentration varying from 15 to 40{\%} over a large concentration range covering several orders of magnitude. The measuring error depends on element type, on the concentration value and also on the number of certified samples used for the initial calibration. The present results are already significant for some field application, such as on-board marine sediment analysis where a significant matrix variation with layer depth is common.},

abstract = {The development of a new laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy technique for the measurement of the attenuation spectrum of tissue is described. The technique, termed laser induced fluorescence attenuation spectroscopy (LIFAS), has been applied to study the effects of hypoxia on the in vivo optical properties of renal and myocardial tissue in the 350-600-nm band. Excimer laser (Xe-Cl) is used to excite a small volume of the tissue (rabbit model, N=20) and induce autofluorescence. The emitted LIF is monitored fiber optically at two locations that are unevenly displaced about the fluorescing volume. The optical attenuation of the tissue is calculated from the dual LIF measurements by assuming an exponential decay of the fluorescence with distance. The results indicate that hypoxia modulates the attenuation spectrum leading to characteristic changes in its shape. Primarily, the spectral profile becomes more concave between 455 nm and 505 nm and two spectral peaks at about 540 and 580 nm disappear leaving in their place a single peak at about 555 nm. The attenuation spectra of normoxic and hypoxic tissue are used to train partial least squares multivariate model for spectral classification. The model detected acute renal and myocardial hypoxia with an accuracy greater than 90{\%} (range: 90{\%}-96{\%}) and 74{\%} (range: 74{\%}-90{\%}), respectively.},

Attributes of a LIBS sensor system include: (i) small size and weight; (ii) technologically mature, inherently rugged, and affordable components; (iii) real-time response; (iv) in situ analysis with no sample preparation required; (v) a high sensitivity to low atomic weight elements which are difficult to determine by other field-portable sensor techniques, and (vi) point sensing or standoff detection. Recent developments in broadband LIBS provide the capability for detection at very high resolution (0.1 nm) of all elements in any unknown target material because all chemical elements emit in the 200-980 nm spectral region.

abstract = {The aim of this work is to provide a procedure to determine time-resolved electron temperatures with minimized relative errors by the Boltzmann plot method. The applied procedure consists of two parts, a systematic theoretical spectral line selection and an iterative Boltzmann plot algorithm. After a pre-selection of an appropriate non-disturbed or overlapped set of spectral lines of a particular atomic or ionic species Boltzmann plots are generated using experimentally recorded data for every time window and laser pulse energy of interest. Spectral lines with the highest average deviations from the regression function are assumed as being not representative for the considered ensemble of spectral lines and are therefore discarded gradually until a threshold value for the coefficient of determination is exceeded. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is applied for time-resolved and spatially integrated investigations of plasmas on 1.1750 C75 steel alloy samples with laser pulse energies ranging between 200 $\mu$J and 2 mJ. For the specific chemical composition ofthese samples a selection of atomic and ionic Fe spectral lines has been carried out. In spite of the fact that onlylaser pulse energies in the low millijoule regime are applied the final sets of spectral lines comprise in total 61Fe I and 12 Fe II emission lines. By applying this method electron temperatures can be determined withaveraged relative errors of down to 1.8{\%} for Fe I and 4.4{\%} for Fe II emission lines.},

In order to improve the signal/background (S/B) ratio, various experimental parameters, such as laser energy, gate delay and width, detector gain, lenses of different focal lengths and sample surface, were tested. In order to provide high reliability and repeatability in the analysis, we also measured plasma parameters, such as electron density and plasma temperature, and determined their influence on the measurement results. The performance of FO LIBS was also compared with that of a LIBS system that does not use a fiber to transmit the laser beam. LIBS spectra with a good S/B were recorded at 2-mus gate delay and width. LIBS spectra of six different Al alloy samples were recorded to obtain calibration data. We were able to obtain linear calibration data for numerous elements (Cr, Zn, Fe, Ni, Mn, Mg and Cu). A linear calibration curve for LIBS intensity ratio vs. concentration ratio reduces the effect of physical variables (i.e. shot-to-shot power fluctuation, sample-to-surface distance, and physical properties of the samples). Our results reveal that this system may be useful in designing a high-temperature LIBS probe for measuring the elemental composition of Al melt.},

abstract = {Soil is unanimously considered as one of the most important sink of heavy metals released by human activities. Heavy metal analysis of natural and polluted soils is generally conducted by the use of atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) or inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on adequately obtained soil extracts. Although in recent years the emergent technique of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been applied widely and with increasing success for the qualitative and quantitative analyses of a number of heavy metals in soil matrices with relevant simplification of the conventional methodologies, the technique still requires further confirmation before it can be applied fully successfully in soil analyses. The main objective of this work was to demonstrate that new developments in LIBS technique are able to provide reliable qualitative and quantitative analytical evaluation of several heavy metals in soils, with special focus on the element chromium (Cr), and with reference to the concentrations measured by conventional ICP spectroscopy. The preliminary qualitative LIBS analysis of five soil samples and one sewage sludge sample has allowed the detection of a number of elements including Al, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Pb, Si, Ti, V and Zn. Of these, a quantitative analysis was also possible for the elements Cr, Cu, Pb, V and Zn based on the obtained linearity of the calibration curves constructed for each heavy metal, i.e., the proportionality between the intensity of the LIBS emission peaks and the concentration of each heavy metal in the sample measured by ICP. In particular, a triplet of emission lines for Cr could be used for its quantitative measurement. The consistency of experiments made on various samples was supported by the same characteristics of the laser-induced plasma (LIP), i.e., the typical linear distribution confirming the existence of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) condition, and similar excitation temperatures and comparable electron number density measured for all samples. An index of the anthropogenic contribution of Cr in polluted soils was calculated in comparison to a non-polluted reference soil. Thus, the intensity ratios of the emission lines of heavy metal can be used to detect in few minutes the polluted areas for which a more detailed sampling and analysis can be useful.},

Spectral information is obtained on a single-laser-shot basis. The effect of incidence angle has been examined from differentiated emission profiles, demonstrating the beneficial effect of working at incidence different from normal.

A wide range of computational methods is employed to estimate the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of proteins. Comprehensive experimental methods, on the other hand, are limited to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and X-ray crystallography. The full characterization of individual structures, using either of these techniques, is extremely time intensive. The demands of high throughput proteomics necessitate the development of new, faster experimental methods for providing structural information. As a first step toward such a method, we explore the possibility of determining the structural classes of proteins directly from their NMR spectra, prior to resonance assignment, using averaged chemical shifts. This is achieved by correlating NMR-based information with empirical structure-based information available in widely used electronic databases. The results are analyzed statistically for their significance. The robustness of the method as a structure predictor is probed by applying it to a set of proteins of unknown structure. Our results show that this NMR-based method can be used as a low-resolution tool for protein structural class identification.},

In photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), corneal ablation rate and final ablation surface quality are strongly dependent on corneal hydration.

Hydrated HEMA samples were irradiated with a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm, 10 mJ/pulse, pulse duration 15 nsec). Successive emission spectra corresponding to different degrees of hydration were recorded on a gated optical multichannel analyzer. The weight of the sample and hence its water content was monitored during the entire procedure with a sensitive balance. One rabbit and one human cornea were used to demonstrate the spectral analogy between the model and corneal tissue. RESULTS: The most noticeable dependence on water content of the substrate was that of atomic emission lines of Ca at 393 nm and 396 nm. CONCLUSION: Plasma emission spectra exhibited significant dependence on sample hydration. This dependence can be used for estimation of water content of irradiated model material and real cornea.},

abstract = {Nanosecond single-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy LIBS has been used to discriminate between two different genera of Gram-negative bacteria and between several strains of the Escherichia coli bacterium based on the relative concentration of trace inorganic elements in the bacteria. Of particular importance in all such studies to date has been the role of divalent cations, specifically Ca2+ and Mg2+, which are present in the membranes of Gram-negative bacteria and act to aggregate the highly polar lipopolysaccharide molecules. We have demonstrated that the source of emission from Ca and Mg atoms observed in LIBS plasmas from bacteria is at least partially located at the outer membrane by intentionally altering membrane biochemistry and correlating these changes with the observed changes in the LIBS spectra. The definitive assignment of some fraction of the LIBS emission to the outer membrane composition establishes a potential serological, or surface-antigen, basis for the laser-based identification. E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were cultured in three nutrient media: trypticase soy agar as a control, a MacConkey agar with a 0.01{\%} concentration of bile salts including sodium deoxycholate, and a trypticase soy agar with a 0.4{\%} deoxycholate concentration. The higher concentration of deoxycholate is known to disrupt bacterial outer membrane integrity and was expected to induce changes in the observed LIBS spectra. Altered LIBS emission was observed for bacteria cultured in this 0.4{\%} medium and laser ablated in an all-argon environment. These spectra evidenced a reduced calcium emission and in the case of one species, a reduced magnesium emission. Culturing on the lower 0.01{\%} concentration of bile salts altered the LIBS spectra for both the P. aeruginosa and two strains of E. coli in a highly reproducible way, although not nearly as significantly as culturing in the higher concentration of deoxycholate did. This was possibly due to the accumulation of divalent cations around the bacteria by the formation of an extracellular polysaccharide capsule. Lastly, a discriminant function analysis demonstrated that in spite of alterations in the LIBS spectrum induced by growth in the three different media, the analysis could correctly identify all samples better than 90{\%} of the time. This encouraging result illustrates the potential utility of LIBS as a rapid bacteriological identification technology. © 2009 American Institute of Physics},

The electron density of the plasma was determined using well-known Stark broadening parameters of spectral lines. The plasma under study had an electron temperature of 13,200 K and an electron number density of 2 x 10(16) cm(-3). The experimental relative transition probabilities were put on an absolute scale using the branching ratio method to calculate Sn I multiplet transition probabilities from available radiative lifetime data of their upper states and plotting the Sn I emission spectrum lines on a Boltzmann plot assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) to be valid and following Boltzmann's law. The LTE conditions and plasma homogeneity have been checked. Special attention was paid to the possible self-absorption of the different transitions. The experimental results obtained have been compared with the experimental values given by other authors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present optical methods at a wide range of wavelengths for remote classification of birds. The proposed methods include eye-safe fluorescence and depolarization lidar techniques, passive scattering spectroscopy, and infrared (IR) spectroscopy. In this paper we refine our previously presented method of remotely classifying birds with the help of laser-induced $\beta$-keratin fluorescence. Phenomena of excitation quenching are studied in the laboratory and are theoretically discussed in detail. It is shown how the ordered microstructures in bird feathers induce structural "colors" in the IR region with wavelengths of around 3-6 $\mu$m. We show that transmittance in this region depends on the angle of incidence of the transmitted light in a species-specific way and that the transmittance exhibits a close correlation to the spatial periodicity in the arrangement of the feather barbules. We present a method by which the microstructure of feathers can be monitored in a remote fashion by utilization of thermal radiation and the wing beating of the bird.},

The sensor presented herein aims to demonstrate the applicability of a hybrid dual Raman-LIBS system as an analytical tool for the standoff analysis of energetic materials. Frequency-doubled 532 nm Nd:YAG nanosecond laser pulses, first expanded and then focused using a 10x beam expander on targets located at 20 m, allowed simultaneous acquisition of Raman-LIBS spectra for 4-mononitrotoluene (MNT), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (DNT), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT), (RDX), C4 and H15 (plastic explosives containing 90{\%} and 75{\%} of RDX by weight, respectively), and Goma2-ECO (Spanish denominated dynamite class high explosive mainly composed of ammonium nitrate, nitroglycol, and dinitrotoluene among other compounds), sodium chlorate, and ammonium nitrate. With the use of a Cassegrain telescope, both Raman and LIBS signals from the same laser pulses were collected and conducted through a bifurcated optical fiber into two identical grating spectrographs coupled to intensified charge-coupled device (iCCD) detectors. With the use of the appropriate timing for each detection mode, adjustment of the laser power on the beam focal conditions is not required. The ability of the present single hybrid sensor to simultaneously acquire, in real time, both molecular and multielemental information from the same laser pulses on the same cross section of the sample at standoff distances greatly enhances the information power of this approach.},

An Nd-YAG laser with 1,064nm wavelength was focused on the surface of leather samples (natural and manufactured) to generate a plasma spark and spectrally resolved spectra were used for identification and quantification of contaminants. The leather samples were collected from a tannery located in industrial cities of Riyadh and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The study was carried out on fully, half manufactured (wet blue leather), and natural hide (skin). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt where laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique has been applied for the analysis of leather before and after tanning process. The maximum concentration of different elements of environmental significance like chromium, lead, arsenic, sulfur, magnesium were 199, 289, 31, 38, and 39ppm, respectively, in one of the manufactured leather samples. The limit of detection (LOD) of our LIBS system for chromium, lead, arsenic, sulfur, and magnesium were 2, 3, 1.5,7, and 3ppm, respectively. The safe permissible limit for tanned leather for highly toxic elements like chromium, lead, and arsenic are 1, 0.5, 0.01ppm, respectively, as prescribed in Environmental Regulation Standards for Saudi Industries set by Royal Commission Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The LIBS technique is superior to other conventional techniques like ICP or atomic absorption that a little or no sample preparation is required, no chemicals are needed, multi-elemental analysis is possible for all kinds of samples (natural and anthropogenic materials), microgram of sample is essential, and LIBS could be applied for remote analysis. It is highly selective and sensitivity higher than ICP, and as no sample and chemicals are required, it is cost effective for multi-sample analysis per unit time as compared with other conventional techniques. The concentration of some toxic elements (Cr, Pb, As) is much higher than the safe permissible limits set by Occupational Safety and Health Administration in USA or Saudi environmental regulatory agencies. Results obtained with our LIBS systems were in close agreement with the results obtained using other standard analytical technique such as the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.},

Comparison of the two stand-off techniques with optical microscopy and electron microprobe point detection confirmed the qualitative analysis capability of both femtosecond remote probing techniques. The R-FIBS technique produced more accurate results compared to fs-LIBS due to the intensity clamping nature of the filament ablation source.

However, atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen contributes to the LIBS signal from the oxygen- and nitrogen-containing explosive compounds, complicating the discrimination of explosives from other organic materials. While bathing the sample in an inert gas will remove atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen interference, it cannot practically be applied for standoff LIBS. Alternatively, we have investigated the potential of double pulse LIBS to improve the discrimination of explosives by diminishing the contribution of atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen to the LIBS signal. These initial studies compare the close-contact 1 m) LIBS spectra of explosives using single pulse LIBS in argon with double pulse LIBS in atmosphere.

It is worth mentioning that the lipstick is not a solid rather is in fluid state which is not trivial to analyze using LIBS technique. For this purpose, special treatment of the lipstick samples was necessary to analyze with our LIBS method.},

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been applied for the determination of plutonium isotope ratios through direct observation of atomic emission from laser-induced plasmas at high resolution. The Pu-239/Pu-240 isotope shift of -0.355 cm-1 from the plutonium atomic line at 594.52202 nm (Blaise et al., The Atomic Spectrum of Plutonium, Argonne National Laboratory Report ANL-83-95, 1984) is clearly resolved in our plasma conditions. Atomic emission is dispersed through a 2-m spectrometer in double pass mode and collected on an electronically gated, intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera. The integrated peak areas obtained from curve-fitting closely match the Pu-239/Pu-240 isotopic ratios obtained from standard methods of thermal ionization mass spectrometry and gamma spectrometry. The observed plutonium linewidths were 0.19 cm-1 (0.0067 nm). These linewidths are within the experimental error of the ideal instrument-limited linewidth, which is calculated to be 0.15 cm-1 (0.0052 nm) based upon the known modulation transfer function for the ICCD system. This linewidth should allow LIBS to be applicable for isotopic ratio measurements for all of the light actinides.},

For this purpose, a compact (51 x 203 x 76 mm) nanosecond Q-switched neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser (8 ns, 20 Hz, 0.01-115 mJ/pulse) was used as an irradiation source.

A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser pulse (7 ns, 1064 nm) was used for ablation of the samples and was followed, after a suitable delay, by an Optical Parametric Oscillator (OPO) laser pulse (7 ns), tuned at 396.15 nm, to resonantly excite the aluminium host atoms. In particular, the Mg I 285.21 nm and Si I 288.16 nm lines were observed in the acquisition spectral window. We investigated the influence of the main experimental parameters, namely, the excitation wavelength, the interpulse delay and the ablation and excitation fluences, on the signal-to-noise ratio for the Mg I 285.21 nm line. We found that, at low ablation fluences, typically less than a few J cm-2, the Mg signal at 285.21 nm achieved using RELIBS was significantly enhanced when compared to LIBS using the same ablation fluence. At fluences higher than 8 J cm-2, the effect of the excitation pulse became unnoticeable and similar results were observed for both approaches. The optimum conditions were achieved for an interpulse delay of about 30 ns, an ablation fluence of about 3.8 J cm-2 and an excitation fluence of about 1.1 J cm-2. The corresponding absolute LoDs were 0.7 and 50 fg, for Mg and Si, respectively, using RELIBS. When using LIBS, they were 4 and 128 fg, instead. Finally, the applicability of RELIBS in the context of a minimally destructive elemental analysis is discussed.},

The analytical method can be deployed for in-situ and/or stand-off analysis with the latter embodiment providing the greatest advantages compared to previous and current elemental analysis methods used for planetary surface analysis. For this application, LIBS must be thoroughly investigated in terms of analytical capabilities and flight-rated instruments must be developed. Because of the low pressure of the predominantly CO2 atmosphere on Mars, studies are needed to understand analytical requirements and to determine performance under these conditions. Stand-off analysis demands the most stringent requirements on instrumentation. Therefore, it must be determined if the high performance components that are normally used in a typical LIBS laboratory setup, which are generally not optimized for small size and weight, are essential to obtain the maximum scientific return from a mission. A key component of a LIBS apparatus is the detection system consisting of a spectrograph and a detector.

abstract = {The application of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) to aerosol systems has been shown to provide quantitative analysis of particle-derived species; however, the exact nature of the plasma/particle interactions remains to be fully understood. Although the plasma/particle interaction may be idealized within a framework of instantaneous vaporization and analyte diffusion throughout the plasma volume, experimental evidence suggests that these processes actually occur on finite time scales relative to the plasma decay times at which measurements are frequently taken. In the present work, a numerical simulation of the temperature and species concentration fields of a plasma containing a single particle, including dissociation and diffusion on semi-empirical finite time scales, is developed. Using these results, the intensity of analyte emission is calculated as a function of time, and the standard ion/neutral ratios typical of aerosol-derived LIBS signals are calculated. Furthermore, the ratio of ion/neutral ratios for two different species was used to assess the temperature homogeneity of the particle-derived analytes in comparison to the overall plasma temperature field. From this numerical study, it is shown that the finite time scale of evaporation and diffusion of aerosol material results in a non-uniform spatial distribution in concentration. This results, in turn, in temperature and free electron density gradients within the plasma, leading to variation between the local conditions surrounding aerosol mass and the bulk conditions of the plasma as a whole. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A ratio calibration curve for Fe with a major element (Al) can also be obtained with which the concentration of Fe in the alloy can be determined. The effects of the surrounding atmosphere on the LIBS spectra of the molten alloy were investigated. Effects of focal length of the lens on the LIBS signals were also studied. LIBS spectra of a solid Al alloy recorded with the same LIBS probe were compared with the LIBS spectra of the molten alloy.

abstract = {Optical emission of laser-induced plasma on the surface of fresh vegetables provides sensitive analysis of trace elements for in situ or online detection of these materials. This emergent technique promises applications with expected outcomes in food security or nutrition quality, as well as environment pollution detection. Characterization of the plasma induced on such soft and humid materials represents the first step towards quantitative measurement using this technique. In this paper, we present the experimental setup and protocol that optimize the plasma generation on fresh vegetables, potatoes for instance. The temporal evolution of the plasma properties are investigated using time-resolved laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). In particular. the electron density and the temperatures of the plasma are reported as functions of its decay time. The temperatures are evaluated from the well known Boltzmann and Saha-Boltzmann plot methods. These temperatures are further compared to that of the typical molecular species, CN, for laser-induced plasma from plant materials. This comparison validates the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the specific case of fresh vegetables ablated in the typical LIBS conditions. A study of the temporal evolution of the signal to noise ratio also provides practical indications for an optimized detection of trace elements. We demonstrate finally that, under certain conditions, the calibration-free LIBS procedure can be applied to determine the concentrations of trace elements in fresh vegetables. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Nearly 1.6 times enhancement in the line emission intensity was observed in the presence of the magnetic field. The temporal evolution of the line emission showed a significant enhancement in plasma emission between 2- and 7- micro(s) gate delays for Mg in the presence of the magnetic field (5-30 micro(s) for Mn). This enhancement in the emission is attributed to an increase in the rate of recombination because of an increase in plasma density due to a magnetic confinement after cooling the plasma. The increase in the optical line emission due to magnetic confinement was absent when the plasma was hot with a dominant background (continuum) emission. The limits of detection of Mg and Mn were reduced by a factor of two in the presence of a steady magnetic field of 5 kilogauss.},

The alloys were tested sequentially in two different noble gases (argon and helium) to enhance discrimination between them. When emission intensities from samples tested sequentially in both gases were combined to form a single 30-spectral line "fingerprint" of the alloy, an overall 100{\%} correct identification was achieved. This was a modest improvement over using emission intensities acquired in argon gas alone. A similar study was performed to demonstrate an enhanced discrimination between two strains of Escherichia coli (a Gram-negative bacterium) and a Gram-positive bacterium. When emission intensities from bacteria sequentially ablated in two different gas environments were combined, the DFA achieved a 100{\%} categorization accuracy. This result showed the benefit of sequentially testing highly similar samples in two different ambient gases to enhance discrimination between the samples.},

abstract = {Aerosolized drug delivery methods have increasingly become popular for pharmaceutical applications. This is mainly due to their ease of application and the more recent advancements incorporating nano-sized generation of particles that find deeper penetration routes and more efficient administration of the drug to specific target organs. Their effectiveness heavily relies on the uniformity of the chemical composition of these aerosolized drugs. Thus, it calls for a real-time on-line analytical tool that can accurately characterize the chemical constituents of the drug powder particles generated to ensure a stringent quality control. We present laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for the first time as an efficient analytical tool to carry out on-line quantitative chemical characterization of aerosolized drugs. We used three different carbon based aerosolized drugs, namely L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt hydrate Iron(II) L-ascorbate (C(12)H(14)FeO(12)), and DL-pantothenic acid hemicalcium salt (C(9)H(16)NO(5)0.5Ca) for our quantitative LIBS studies here. Our results show that LIBS can effectively estimate the quantitative ratios of carbon to various trace elements for each of these drugs, thereby enabling on-line unique characterization of individual aerosolized drugs. The quantitative LIBS technique predicted the C/Mg, C/Fe, and C/Ca ratios as 4.02+/-0.76, 12.42+/-2.36, and 18.47+/-4.39 for each of the above aerosolized drugs, respectively. Within error limits, we find these ratios in good agreement with the respective stoichiometric values of 4, 12, and 18 corresponding to the drugs above. Thus, the work demonstrated the utility and validity of LIBS in accurate on-line identification of drug powders during real-time manufacturing processes.},

The extracted spectral signatures show robustness to different degree. The correlation assessment showed good results in most cases where the LIF signal to noise ratio was significant. The sensor 4$\sigma$ sensitivity was evaluated to 1 300, 600, 100 and 30 ppl for BG, OV, MS2 and EH respectively. Correlation results are presented by plotting the SINBAHD metric versus the corresponding particle concentration, in which case, the obtained slope is proportional to the material fluorescence cross-section.

The Coso Volcanic Field (CVF) in California, USA, contains at least 38 high-silica rhyolite domes, many of which contain obsidian glass that has been quarried for tools by the indigenous population for more than 12,000 years. Artifacts made from CVF obsidian are found throughout the southwestern United States and geochemical sourcing of CVF obsidian has been an important tool in understanding prehistoric Native American trading patterns. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a simple atomic emission spectroscopic technique that has the potential for real-time man-portable chemical analysis in the field. Because LIBS is simultaneously sensitive to all elements, a single laser shot can be used to record the broadband emission spectra, which provides a chemical fingerprint of a material. Single-shot broadband LIBS spectra were collected using a commercial benchtop LIBS system for 27 obsidian samples from major sites across the CVF and four additional sites in California and western Nevada outside of CVF. Classification of the samples was performed using partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), a common chemometric technique suitable for performing regression on high-dimensional data. Provenance identification for the obsidian samples was evaluated for three separate labeling frameworks. The first framework consisted of a binary classification problem to distinguish CVF samples from non-CVF samples. The second approach focused on the CVF samples with labels that corresponded to the eight separate Coso sites encompassed by the 27 samples. In the third analysis, non-CVF samples were excluded, and the remaining 27 CVF samples were labeled based on groupings defined from previous major and trace element chemical studies, which reduces the number of possible classes from eight to four. Different aspects of the classifier setup considered in this study include the training/testing routine (a 27-fold leave-one-sample-out setup versus a simple split of the data into separate sets for training and evaluation), the number of latent variables used in the regression model, and whether PLSDA operating on the entire broadband LIBS spectrum is superior to that using only a selected subset of LIBS emission lines. The results point to the robustness of the PLSDA technique and suggest that LIBS analysis combined with the appropriate statistical signal processing has the potential to be a useful tool for chemical analysis of archaeological artifacts and geological specimens.},

The optical emission spectroscopy from a laser-induced plasma generated by a 10 640 angstrom radiation, with an irradiance of 1.4 x 10(10) Wcm(-2) on an Sn-Pb alloy (an Sn content of approximately 20{\%}), in vacuum, was recorded at 0.8 mu s, and analysed between 1900 and 7000 angstrom. The population-level distribution and corresponding temperature were obtained using Boltzmann plots. The electron density of the plasma was determined using well-known Stark broadening parameters of spectral lines. The plasma under study had an electron temperature of 13,200 K and an electron number density of 2 x 10(16) cm(-3). The experimental relative transition probabilities were put on an absolute scale using the branching ratio method to calculate Sn I multiplet transition probabilities from available radiative lifetime data of their upper states and plotting the Sn I emission spectrum lines on a Boltzmann plot assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) to be valid and following Boltzmann's law. The LTE conditions and plasma homogeneity have been checked. Special attention was paid to the possible self-absorption of the different transitions. The experimental results obtained have been compared with the experimental values given by other authors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Effects of a steady magnetic field on the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy of certain elements (Mn, Mg, Cr, and Ti) in aqueous solution were studied, in which the plasma plume expanded across an external steady magnetic field (approximately 6 kilogauss). Nearly 1.6 times enhancement in the line emission intensity was observed in the presence of the magnetic field. The temporal evolution of the line emission showed a significant enhancement in plasma emission between 2- and 7- micro(s) gate delays for Mg in the presence of the magnetic field (5-30 micro(s) for Mn). This enhancement in the emission is attributed to an increase in the rate of recombination because of an increase in plasma density due to a magnetic confinement after cooling the plasma. The increase in the optical line emission due to magnetic confinement was absent when the plasma was hot with a dominant background (continuum) emission. The limits of detection of Mg and Mn were reduced by a factor of two in the presence of a steady magnetic field of 5 kilogauss.},

The influence of the main experimental parameters, namely the ablation fluence, the excitation fluence, and the inter-pulse delay was studied to maximize the fluorescence signal. The plasma was produced by a 266 nm frequency-quadrupled Q-switched Nd:YAG laser and the trace elements under investigation were then re-excited by a nanosecond optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser, delivering pulses in the sub-mJ energy range, and tuned to strong absorption lines of the trace elements. The reproducibility of the measurements was improved using a home-made flow-cell, and relative standard deviations as low as 6.7{\%} for a series of 100 shots were attained with a repetition rate of 0.7 Hz. Using the LIBS-LIF technique, we demonstrated LoDs of 39 ppb and 65 ppb for Pb and Fe, respectively, accumulating over 100 laser shots only, which correspond to an improvement of about 500 times with respect to LIBS.},

We present characteristics of the spectra obtained from organic samples with special attentions on the emissions of organic elements, O and N, and molecular bonds CN. The choice of these atomic or molecular species is justified on one hand, by the importance of these species to specify organic or biological materials; and on the other hand by the possible interferences with ambient air when laser ablation takes place in the atmosphere. Time-resolved LIBS was used to determine the time-evolution of line intensity emitted from these species. We demonstrate different kinetic behaviors corresponding to different origins of emitters: native atomic or molecular species directly vaporized from the sample or those generated through dissociation or recombination due to interaction between laser-induced plasma and air molecules.

Corrections of the mea- surements are introduced in order to take into account common problems that often prevent a truly quantitative application of the DRIFTS ana- lytical method. Effects on the measured data due to the background absorption of the sample and to the specular reflection on its surface are discussed and quantitatively corrected for. The possible existence of gradients of the optical properties of the powder medium is taken into account by a numerical adaptation of the model to inhomogeneities of the phenomenological absorption and scattering coefficients K and S. Model systems constituted of two types of silica powders of very different morphology are prepared. Known concentrations of molecules carrying a cyano functional group as chromophore were covalently anchored on the powder surface. Application of the adapted model gives a quite good description of the measured diffuse reflectance and diffuse transmittance in these cases where the simple Kubelka-Munk function fails.},

abstract = {This work presents a technique by which a low resolution approximately 1 nm) fiberoptic spectrometer may be used to definitively identify elements and molecular fragments in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Commercial laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) spectrometers have high resolution in the area of spectral interest, and software is used to identify elements via a look-up table containing known spectral lines. When analyzing spectra from a lower resolution fiber-optic spectrometer, software based on look-up tables can produce erroneous results, reporting elements absent from the sample. As a solution to this problem, an analysis using the coherence function in conjunction with Welch's method is used to compare sample spectra with a library of reference spectra, which contain peaks primarily from a single element. The analysis has proved to be adept at identifying specific elemental signatures in multi-component samples. The technique leverages the increased information content of concomitant atomic emission lines, which are easily collected with a low resolution broadband (200-1100 nm) fiber-optic spectrometer. This technique alleviates the need for the user to visually verify the vicinity of individual peaks during testing. While Pearson's method is generally used for this type of analysis, we show that Welch's method has the advantage of being less susceptible to problems caused by continuum background.},

For this purpose, a commercial electro-optically (EO) Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was employed, where by reducing the delay between the Q-switch opening and the flash lamp, a train of pulses (up to 11) separated by approximately 7.40 $\mu$s was generated during one lamp flashing. Plasma emission after each individual laser pulse of the MP sequence was detected by a spectrograph equipped with an intensified charge-coupled device (iCCD) detector. With MP excitation, the ablation efficiency was increased ten-fold on iron sample and 22.5-fold on zinc material with respect to dual-pulse or single-pulse excitation. The LIBS signal generated by MP excitation shows an analogous enhancement. Although the total energy per shot delivered to samples was only 60 mJ, it was possible using LIBS to measure the sample stratigraphy up to depths of 90 $\mu$m on zinc-coated steel sheets. A satisfactory agreement between the Zn thickness determined by the MP-LIBS system and data from the manufacturer has also been obtained.},

As most norms rely on migration (lixiviation) protocols, chemometric classification models from LIBS spectra were tested for sampling toys that present potential risk of Cd, Cr and Pb contamination. The classification models were generated from the emission spectra of 51 polymeric toys and by using Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The classification models and validations were carried out with 40 and 11 test samples, respectively.

The objective was to determine the influence of particle size and mineral phase on the LIBS signal. The LIBS spectra of hematite and magnetite ore concentrates were qualitatively indistinguishable from each other but magnetite yielded systematically less than hematite. This behavior could be set into an empirical equation to correct the iron peak intensities according to the level of magnetite in the analyzed sample. Similarly, an increase of the LIBS signal was observed as the particle size of the ore samples decreased. Again, an equation could be written down to correct the intensity of either iron or silicon in response to a variation of the average particle size of the ore concentrate. Using these corrections, proper response of the silicon signal against the concentration of silica in the samples was restored. The observed dependence of the strength of the iron signal upon the mineral phase is attributed to oxidation of magnetite into hematite.},

A number of challenges associated with detection of explosives residues using LIBS have been identified, along with their possible solutions. Several groups have investigated methods for improving the sensitivity and selectivity of LIBS for detection of explosives, including the use of femtosecond-pulse lasers, supplemental enhancement of the laser-induced plasma emission, and complementary orthogonal techniques. Despite the associated challenges, researchers have demonstrated the tremendous potential of LIBS for real-time detection of explosives residues at standoff distances.},

abstract = {Recent improvements in single particle mass spectrometers make it possible to optically detect, size, and characterize the compositions of individual particles with diameters larger than a micron and smaller than 100 nm. In these instruments, two stages of optical detection are used to generate a precisely timed trigger pulse that is used to fire the ion generation laser or lasers. However, experience shows that the wide particle size range results in significant differences in laser trigger timing between small and large particles. If not treated these differences produce an instrument with size dependent hit-rate. In this case the operator is forced to optimize the instrument for the desired size range, while contending with a significantly lower hit-rate for other particle sizes. This article presents an analysis of the phenomenon and demonstrates that the dependence of laser trigger timing on particle size stems from the differences in the particle position within the detection laser beam at the instant of detection. We demonstrate that it is possible to compensate for these differences by generating, for each particle, a laser trigger delay coefficient that is a function of particle’s time of flight, i.e., its vacuum aerodynamic size. The study also shows that a single function can be used to eliminate the size bias for particles with a wide range of densities.},

abstract = {We explore the use of a combination of double-pulse and single-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) methodologies as a means of differentiating between solid-phase and gaseous-phase analytes (namely, carbon) in an aerosol stream. A range of spectral data was recorded for double-pulse and singlepulse configurations, including both ns and fs prepulse widths, while varying the gas-phase mass percentage of the carbon from about 10{\%} to 90{\%} for various fixed carbon concentrations. The carbon emission response, as measured by the peak-to-continuum ratio, was greater for the double-pulse configuration as compared with the single-pulse response and was also enhanced as the percentage of solid-phase carbon was increased. Using a combination of the double-pulse and single-pulse emission signals, a monotonically increasing response function was found to correlate with the percentage of gas-phase analyte. However, individual data points at the measured gas-phase percentages reveal considerable scatter from the predicted trend. Furthermore, the double-pulse to single-pulse ratio was only pronounced with the ns–ns configuration as compared with the fs–ns scheme. Overall, the LIBS methodology has been demonstrated as a potential means to discriminate between gas-phase and particulatephase fractions of the same elemental species in an aerosol, although future optimization of the temporal parameters should be explored to improve the precision and accuracy of this approach. © 2010 Optical Society of America},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: As part of a program project to evaluate emerging optical technologies for cervical neoplasia, we performed fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopic examinations of patients with abnormal Papanicolaou smears. Biopsy specimens were taken from each area and measured optically, and study pathologists performed qualitative histopathologic readings. Several methodologic issues arose in this analysis: (1) the interpathologist and intrapathologist agreement between institutions for the 1790 biopsy specimens; (2) the interinstitutional agreement among the two institutions conducting the trials on 117 randomly chosen biopsy specimens; (3) the interinstitutional agreement among the two institutions and a third expert gynecologic pathologist to ensure the expert readings were comparable to those outside both institutions on 117 randomly chosen biopsy specimens; and (4) an additional three reviews of the 106 difficult biopsy specimens by all three institutions. METHODS: All 1790 specimens from 850 patients were reviewed three times at each institution in blinded fashion; those for which the first and second reviews were identical were not reviewed a third time. A randomly selected sample of 117 specimens was randomly ordered and read by study pathologists at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA), and Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). The 106 difficult cases were treated in the same manner as the randomized and random-ordered cases. Generalized, unweighted, and weighted kappas and their 95{\%} confidence intervals were used to assess agreement. Binary comparisons were used to compare diagnostic categories. FINDINGS: The kappas for the three readings of the overall data set using eight-category World Health Organization (WHO) criteria were as follows: 0.66 for the generalized, 0.72 for weighted, and ranged from 0.59 to 0.94 unweighted binary categories; those read using four-category Bethesda criteria: 0.70 for generalized, 0.69 for weighted, and 0.56-0.94 for unweighted binary categories. For the pool versus the study pathologist readings, the eight-category kappa was 0.51 for generalized, 0.72 for weighted, and 0.56-0.82 for unweighted binary categories; for those read using Bethesda criteria: 0.70 for generalized, 0.70 for weighted, and 0.59-0.82 for the unweighted binary categories. The interpathologist and intrapathologist readings were fair by Landis standards at the low end of the diagnostic scale (atypia, human papillomavirus, and CIN1) and substantial to almost perfect at the high end (CIN2, CIN3, and CIS). The randomly selected and randomly ordered sample of 117 specimens read with the WHO system yielded a generalized kappa of 0.45; among the three institutions (M. D. Anderson Cancer Center vs. BCCA, M. D. Anderson vs. BWH, and BCCA vs. BWH), the unweighted kappas were 0.46, 0.41, and 0.49 and the weighted were 0.65, 0.66, and 0.68, respectively; for the Bethesda, a generalized kappa of 0.65, unweighted kappas of 0.66, 0.65, and 0.47, and weighted of 0.74, 0.72, and 0.74. The difficult specimens read with the WHO system yielded a generalized kappa of 0.23; among the three institutions the unweighted kappas were 0.20, 0.30, and 0.37, and the weighted were 0.17, 0.34, and 0.31; for the Bethesda, a generalized kappa of 0.25; among the three institutions, the unweighted kappas were 0.21, 0.32, and 0.37, and the weighted were: 0.07, 0.21, and 0.37, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Kappas in this expert group of pathologists were in the moderate, substantial, and almost perfect ranges for the overall and randomized samples. The randomized sample was representative of the larger sample. The kappa of the specimens for which disagreements arose was, predictably, in the slight range. Our findings will aid both the correlations with optical measurements using fluorescence and reflectance spectroscopy and the quantitative histopathologic analysis of these study specimens.},

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a rapid quantitative analytical technique that can be used to determine the elemental composition of numerous sample matrices, and it has been successfully applied in many types of samples. However, for chemically and physically complex soil samples, its quantitative analytical ability is controversial. Multivariate analytical techniques have great potential for analyzing the complex LIBS spectra. To demonstrate the feasibility of LIBS as an alternative technique to quantitatively analyze soil samples, the univariate and the partial least square (PLS) techniques are used to analyze the LIBS spectra of 12 soil samples and to build calibration models predicting Cu and Zn concentrations. The results show that PLS can significantly improve the analytical results compared with the univariate technique. The normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and r2 of the univariate models are 16.60{\%} and 0.71 in calibration and 18.80{\%} and 0.62 in prediction for Cu and 18.97{\%} and 0.62 in calibration and 22.81{\%} and 0.45 in prediction for Zn. For the PLS models using the spectral range 300 to 350 nm, the NRMSE and r2 are 1.94{\%} and 0.99 for both Cu and Zn in calibration and 7.90{\%} and 0.94 for Cu and 8.14{\%} and 0.94 for Zn in prediction, respectively. Compared with the univariate technique, PLS improves the NRMSE 87.53{\%} and 87.78{\%} in calibration and 44.47{\%} and 53.44{\%} in prediction for Cu and Zn, respectively. The results indicate that PLS can improve the quantitative analytical ability of LIBS for soil sample analysis. (C) 2010 Lippincott Williams {\&} Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract = {The catalytically competent active-site structure of a true acylenzyme reaction intermediate of TEM-1 beta-lactamase formed with the kinetically specific spin-labeled substrate 6-N-(2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-1-oxypyrrolinyl-3-carboxyl)-penicillanic acid isolated under cryoenzymologic conditions has been determined by angle-selected electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy. Cryoenzymologic experiments with use of the chromophoric substrate 6-N-3-(2-furanyl)-propen-2-oyl-penicillanic acid showed that the acylenzyme reaction intermediate could be stabilized in the -35 to -75 degrees C range with a half-life suitably long to allow freeze-quenching of the reaction species for ENDOR studies while a noncovalent Michaelis complex could be optically identified at temperatures only below -70 degrees C. The wild-type, Glu166Asn, Glu240Cys, and Met272Cys mutant forms of the mature enzyme were overexpressed in perdeuterated minimal medium to allow detection and assignment of proton resonances specific for the substrate and chemically modified amino acid residues in the active site. From analysis of the dependence of the ENDOR spectra on the setting of the static laboratory magnetic field H0, the dipolar contributions to the principal hyperfine coupling components were estimated to calculate the separations between the unpaired electron of the nitroxyl group and isotopically identified nuclei. These electron-nucleus distances were applied as constraints to assign the conformation of the substrate in the active site and of amino acid side chains by molecular modeling. Of special interest was that the ENDOR spectra revealed a water molecule sequestered in the active site of the acylenzyme of the wild-type protein that was not detected in the deacylation impaired Glu166Asn mutant. On the basis of the X-ray structure of the enzyme, the ENDOR distance constraints placed this water molecule within hydrogen-bonding distance to the carboxylate side chain of glutamate-166 as if it were poised for nucleophilic attack of the scissile ester bond. The ENDOR results provide experimental evidence of glutamate-166 in its functional role as the general base catalyst in the wild-type enzyme for hydrolytic breakdown of the acylenzyme reaction intermediate of TEM-1 beta-lactamase.},

Some other investigations and applications were also included. The factors, which influence the detection capability, were discussed. Laser wavelength, pulse energy, power density, environmental atmosphere, external electric field, carbon layer on sample surface, sample material characteristic, and so on all have effects on the precision and the limit of detection. Finally, a simple introduction of the improvements in experimental equipment and methods was also covered. The development of laser-induced plasma spectral analysis technique creates favorable conditions, such as convenience and shortcut, for many science and application researches.

abstract = {Time-saving, low-cost analyses of soil contamination are required to ensure fast and efficient pollution removal and remedial operations. In this work, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been successfully applied to in situ analyses of polluted soils, providing direct semi-quantitative information about the extent of pollution. A field campaign has been carried out in Brittany (France) on a site presenting high levels of heavy metal concentrations. Results on iron as a major component as well as on lead and copper as minor components are reported. Soil samples were dried and prepared as pressed pellets to minimize the effects of moisture and density on the results. LIBS analyses were performed with a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm, 60 mJ per 10 ns pulse, at a repetition rate of 10 Hz with a diameter of 500 $\mu$m on the sample surface. Good correlations were obtained between the LIBS signals and the values of concentrations deduced from inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). This result proves that LIBS is an efficient method for optimizing sampling operations. Indeed, "LIBS maps" were established directly on-site, providing valuable assistance in optimizing the selection of the most relevant samples for future expensive and time-consuming laboratory analysis and avoiding useless analyses of very similar samples. Finally, it is emphasized that in situ LIBS is not described here as an alternative quantitative analytical method to the usual laboratory measurements but simply as an efficient time-saving tool to optimize sampling operations and to drastically reduce the number of soil samples to be analyzed, thus reducing costs. The detection limits of 200 ppm for lead and 80 ppm for copper reported here are compatible with the thresholds of toxicity; thus, this in situ LIBS campaign was fully validated for these two elements. Consequently, further experiments are planned to extend this study to other chemical elements and other matrices of soils.},

abstract = {A mobile Laser-Induced Breakdown Detection (LIBD) system is developed for the field study of the aquatic colloid migration. The principle of LIBD is based on the plasma generation at breakdown of colloids in the laser focus region, which is then observed by either photo-acoustic detection or optical monitoring. The method provides information on the number density and average size of colloids. The present instrumentation built up particularly for the field study is applied for the aquatic colloid migration in a natural granite fracture. The study is performed within the Colloid and Radionuclide Retention project (CRR) in order to investigate the role of colloids on the radionuclide migration, For this purpose, bentonite colloids dispersed in granite groundwater are injected into a rock fracture zone with a dipole distance of 5 m. After passing through the fracture, the groundwater is guided into a flow-through detection cell of LIBD for the quantification of colloids. Another experiment is performed with the same colloids traced by tetra- and tri-valent metal ions, Th(IV), Hf(IV) and Tb(III). The recovery of colloids as found by LIDB appears to be about 55 5{\%} of the injected colloid mass concentration, which is corroborated by ICP-MS analysis of Al present in bentonite colloids. An average size of recovered colloids is slightly decreased from the value of before injection and hence the relative number density increased in the course of the rock fracture migration. Recovered fractions of colloid-borne trace elements in the extracted groundwater are 78 8{\%} for both tetra-valent elements and 33 3{\%} for trivalent element of the originally traced concentrations. Plausible explanations are given for the different recoveries of heavy metal ions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The membrane was then ablated with the focused energy of a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm. The emitted light was collected by an echelle spectrometer through a fiber-optic cable and detected with an intensified charge-coupled device (CCD). Ten different metals, most covered by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), were studied. The concentrations of barium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, silver, lead, mercury, nickel, and zinc can be measured simultaneously with limits of detection ranging from 2 $\mu$g/mL to 4 ng/mL. The linear range is 2-6 orders of magnitude depending upon the element and sampling method. The major advantages of the technique are the multielement capability and the ease of sample preparation.},

abstract = {A simplified procedure for correcting self-absorption effect was proposed in calibration-free laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (CF-LIBS). In typical LIBS measurement conditions, the plasma produced is often optically thick, especially for the strong lines of major elements. The selection of self-absorption lines destroys the performance of CF-LIBS, and the familiar correction method based on the curve of growth is complex in implementation. The procedure we proposed, named internal reference for self-absorption correction (IRSAC), first chose an internal reference line for each species, then compared other spectral line intensity of the same species with the reference line to estimate the self-absorption degrees of other spectral lines, and finally achieved an optimal correction by a regressive algorithm. The self-absorption effect of the selected reference line can be ignored, since the reference line with high excitation energy of the upper level is slightly affected by the self-absorption. Through the IRSAC method, the points on the Boltzmann plot become more regular, and the evaluations of the plasma temperature and material composition are more accurate than the basic CF-LIBS.},

The sample in the form of liquid droplets is generated with an electrospray ionization needle. The microdroplets are interacted with an impinging laser pulse approximately 2 mm downstream from the needle tip. A sequence of single-shot time-resolved LIB emission signals of Na, K and Al is detected, respectively. The LIB signal intensity integrated within a gate linearly correlates with the plasma current obtained simultaneously on a single-shot basis. The correlation plot exhibits a straight line, of which the slope increases with the sample concentration. Given the calibration curves and the focused cross-sections of the incident laser beam, the detection limits may be determined to be 0.630.02 (0.3 pg), 1.20.1 (0.5 pg), and 435 mg/l (21 pg) for Na, K, and Al, respectively. As compared to the correlation methods applied, our treatment is more straightforward to yield concentration information and the resulting detection limits are comparable to those reported previously. The dependence of the correlation plot on the adopted laser energy and wavelength is also characterized. The detection limits tend to be improved by applying a laser with larger pulse energy but shorter wavelengths.},

Therefore, the detection and correction of varying continuum background emission are not easily accomplished. The aim of this work is to present a method that can automatically estimate and correct varying continuum background emission, which is representative in laser-induced plasma. In this method, we first find all minima on a spectrum, and then deduct the unreasonable minima by a proper threshold. Finally, we use one or multiple polynomial functions through the minima left to approximate the continuum backgrounds. The validity of this method was evaluated by using several spectra with different complexities and wavelength ranges. We also applied this method to optimize the measurement time delays of detectors. In addition, for five aluminum alloy samples, we compared their elemental calibration cures between original spectra and background-corrected spectra. Experimental results proved that the method proposed in this paper can well estimate varying continuum backgrounds over a wide range of wavelengths.},

abstract = {Abstract The radiation hardness and mechanical strength of single-and two-phase glasses are studied for the case when nanosecond laser pulses ($\lambda$= 1.06 $\mu$m, $\tau$0.5 12.5 ns) are focused inside the material. Laser interferometry is applied to measure the displacement of the free surface, find optical breakage thresholds, and carry out the fractographic analysis of damaged regions. It is shown that breakdown channels and damage regions develop in a nonlinear manner according to optical breakdown mechanisms, changing each other with an increase in the laser energy. The strength of the two-phase glass is found to be more than four times that of the single-phase glass, although their elastic properties differ insignificantly. Such a considerable difference in the hardness of these materials with chemically similar constitutents is attributed to the presence of the double-lattice nanometer-scale structure of the two-phase glass.},

These results for palladium-dispersed films have been correlated to a calibration curve obtained by use of atomic absorption spectroscopy and were found to be in good agreement. The experiments were conducted by use of wet and dry metal-doped membranes. The metal peaks obtained with a dry membrane are greater than five times higher in signal-to-background ratio than when metals are detected by a hydrated membrane. The advantage of this laser-based technique is that minimal sample handling and sample preparation are needed and measurements are completed in real time (a few seconds). Hence this technique can be used for the detection of metals in dry membranes that would be used in the construction of electrode assemblies.},

abstract = {Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and molybdenum trioxide are investigated using Raman spectroscopy with emphasis on the application to tribological systems. The Raman vibrational modes were investigated for excitation wavelengths at 632.8 and 488 nm using both micro-crystalline MoS2 powder and natural MoS2 crystals. Differences are noted in the Raman spectra for these two different wavelengths, which are attributed to resonance effects due to overlap of the 632.8 nm source with electronic absorption bands. In addition, significant laser intensity effects are found that result in laser-induced transformation of MoS2 to MoO3. Finally, the transformation to molybdenum trioxide is explored as a function of temperature and atmosphere, revealing an apparent transformation at 375 K in the presence of oxygen. Overall, Raman spectroscopy is an useful tool for tribological study of MoS2 coatings, including the role of molybdenum trioxide transformations, although careful attention must be given to the laser excitation parameters (both wavelength and intensity) when interpreting Raman spectra.},

abstract = {Nanosecond single-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy LIBS has been used to discriminate between two different genera of Gram-negative bacteria and between several strains of the Escherichia coli bacterium based on the relative concentration of trace inorganic elements in the bacteria. Of particular importance in all such studies to date has been the role of divalent cations, specifically Ca2+ and Mg2+, which are present in the membranes of Gram-negative bacteria and act to aggregate the highly polar lipopolysaccharide molecules. We have demonstrated that the source of emission from Ca and Mg atoms observed in LIBS plasmas from bacteria is at least partially located at the outer membrane by intentionally altering membrane biochemistry and correlating these changes with the observed changes in the LIBS spectra. The definitive assignment of some fraction of the LIBS emission to the outer membrane composition establishes a potential serological, or surface-antigen, basis for the laser-based identification. E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were cultured in three nutrient media: trypticase soy agar as a control, a MacConkey agar with a 0.01{\%} concentration of bile salts including sodium deoxycholate, and a trypticase soy agar with a 0.4{\%} deoxycholate concentration. The higher concentration of deoxycholate is known to disrupt bacterial outer membrane integrity and was expected to induce changes in the observed LIBS spectra. Altered LIBS emission was observed for bacteria cultured in this 0.4{\%} medium and laser ablated in an all-argon environment. These spectra evidenced a reduced calcium emission and in the case of one species, a reduced magnesium emission. Culturing on the lower 0.01{\%} concentration of bile salts altered the LIBS spectra for both the P. aeruginosa and two strains of E. coli in a highly reproducible way, although not nearly as significantly as culturing in the higher concentration of deoxycholate did. This was possibly due to the accumulation of divalent cations around the bacteria by the formation of an extracellular polysaccharide capsule. Lastly, a discriminant function analysis demonstrated that in spite of alterations in the LIBS spectrum induced by growth in the three different media, the analysis could correctly identify all samples better than 90{\%} of the time. This encouraging result illustrates the potential utility of LIBS as a rapid bacteriological identification technology. © 2009 American Institute of Physics},

Time-integrated optical spectra emitted from the laser spark have been measured and analyzed. The spectra of the plasma generated in the CO-containing mixtures are dominated by emission of both C2 and CN radicals. A vibrational temperature of approximately 10(4) K was determined according to an intensity distribution in a vibronic structure of the CN (B2Sigma(+)u-X2Sigma(+)g) violet band. For comparison, the NH3-CH4-H2-H2O mixture has been irradiated as a model of the strongly reducing version of the early earth's atmosphere. In this mixture, excited CN seems to be significantly less abundant than C2. The LIDB experiments were in the molecular gases carried out not only in the static cell but also using a large, double stream pulse jet (gas puff target) placed in the vacuum interaction chamber. The obtained soft X-ray emission spectra indicate the presence of highly charged atomic ions in the hot core of high-power laser sparks.},

LIBS experiments were carried out in air and using Al, Cu, Si and Zn metallic targets. It was found that the use of 7 laser pulses, separated by ca. 25 micro signs time intervals, enhance line emissions by a factor of 2.5 to 129 with respect to the single-pulse case, and also decrease the relative standard deviation of the signal based on five consecutive measurements to 2-5{\%}. Time-resolved emission data and the observation of ablation craters suggest that the signal enhancement is mainly attributable to the reheating of the plasma by multiple laser pulses.},

The characterization of the FBGs photoacoustic response is based on the experimental comparison with a static lateral strain source and on theoretical analysis using the piecewise-uniform approach to photoelastic theory. The temporal resolution of the response is determined by the arrangement of the FBG with respect to the source of the acoustic wave and is better than 150 ns, as was verified in a deconvolution analysis. The method has not only a fast time response but also is simple, inexpensive, and accurate as indicated by the good agreement of the experimental photoacoustic spectrum with previous measurements.

@article{Smith2000,
abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has become a very popular analytical method in the last decade in view of some of its unique features such as applicability to any type of sample, practically no sample preparation, remote sensing capability, and speed of analysis. The technique has a remarkably wide applicability in many fields, and the number of applications is still growing. From an analytical point of view, the quantitative aspects of LIBS may be considered its Achilles' heel, first due to the complex nature of the laser-sample interaction processes, which depend upon both the laser characteristics and the sample material properties, and second due to the plasma-particle interaction processes, which are space and time dependent. Together, these may cause undesirable matrix effects. Ways of alleviating these problems rely upon the description of the plasma excitation-ionization processes through the use of classical equilibrium relations and therefore on the assumption that the laser-induced plasma is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). Even in this case, the transient nature of the plasma and its spatial inhomogeneity need to be considered and overcome in order to justify the theoretical assumptions made. This first article focuses on the basic diagnostics aspects and presents a review of the past and recent LIBS literature pertinent to this topic. Previous research on non-laser-based plasma literature, and the resulting knowledge, is also emphasized. The aim is, on one hand, to make the readers aware of such knowledge and on the other hand to trigger the interest of the LIBS community, as well as the larger analytical plasma community, in attempting some diagnostic approaches that have not yet been fully exploited in LIBS.},

The elements detected in the stones were calcium, magnesium, manganese, copper, iron, zinc, strontium, sodium, potassium, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine (Cl), etc. We optimized the LIBS signals by varying the laser energy from 10 mJ to 40 mJ to obtain the best signal-to-background and signal-to-noise ratios. We estimated the quantities of different elements in the stones by drawing calibration curves, plotting graphs of the analyte signal versus the absolute concentration of the elements in standard samples. The detection limits of the calibration curves were discussed. The concentrations of the different elements were found to be widely different in different stones found in different age groups of patients. It was observed that stones containing higher amounts of copper also possessed higher amounts of zinc. In general, the concentrations of trace elements present in the kidney stones decreased as we moved from center to shell and surface. Our results also revealed that the concentrations of elements present in the stones increased with the age of the patients. The results obtained from the calibration curves were compared with results from inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

Special attention is paid to collisional-radiative (CR) and collisional-dominated (CD) plasma models where radiative processes play an important role. Also, calibration-free (CF) models are considered which may endow with the possibility for standardless spectroscopic analysis. In the diagnostic part, only methods based on the use of additional diagnostic tools (auxiliary lasers, optics, and probes) are described omitting those based on plasma own radiation. A short review is provided on image-based diagnostics (shadowgraphy, schlieren, and interferometry), absorption and fluorescence, Langmuir probe, and less frequently used cavity ringdown and Thomson scattering methods.

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is used for the identification of the presence of hazardous bacteria in food. In this study, our main focus was centered on the identification of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, a Gram-negative foodborne pathogen, in various liquids such as milk, chicken broth, and brain heart infusion due to the infection being most prevalent in raw meat and dairy products. A Nd:YAG laser of operating wavelength 266 nm was used to obtain the spectra from the artificially inoculated liquid samples. A series of experiments were performed to determine the effectiveness of LIBS to discriminate the bacteria from the background liquids. These results are compared with competing modern molecular methods of detection which include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR. In addition to analyzing S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, another common Gram-negative, Escherichia coli, as well as Gram-positive pathogen, Staphlycoccus auerus, were used to determine the specificity of the LIBS technique.},

abstract = {The objective of this work was to study with near infrared spectrometry (NIRS) the degree of mixing of poorly miscible binary mixtures of carbamazepine (CBZ) and alpha-lactose monohydrate (LMH). CBZ was cohesive and the particle size difference between CBZ (0.3microm) and LMH (75microm) was substantial. Mixed batches were measured directly in the mixing container with a fiber-optic probe. The spectral data were filtered by applying a novel automated selection technique during the NIRS measurement. The data analyses were performed with partial least squares modeling. Reference measurements were carried out with ultraviolet spectrophotometry. The results describe the degree of homogeneity at various depths. Some of the mixtures densified when the mixing speed increased. The densification of the batches was a source of error because it caused changes in the measuring geometry. The automated selection technique for the spectra reduced this problem. NIRS detected differences in the mixing degrees of mixtures and the method is suitable for mixing studies. However, the difference in the particle size of the materials and the densification caused problems to the measuring geometry. NIRS can be used at line, but the method requires accurate operation and method developing before it is useable.},

abstract = {The calibration-free methodology described in the literature dealing with the technique of laser induced breakdown spectroscopy has been applied here to several samples under different operating pressures with the aim of classifying the analytical technique as quantitative, semi-quantitative or qualitative (with quantitative estimates only), depending on the relative percentage errors calculated for the major, minor and trace elemental composition of the sample. The results were obtained with a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm), characterized by 5.3 ns duration pulses at a maximum repetition frequency of 10 Hz and with pulse energy up to 300 mJ. The spectra were taken with a grating monochromator coupled with an intensified CCD detector, calibrated from 220 to 700 nm. The samples investigated were aluminum alloy standard disks, standard reference materials of Zn alloy, Cu-Ni alloy, Ti alloy, Ni alloy powder, Cu-Zn alloy and soils. The data are compared with those published in the literature. The results show that the best accuracy (5{\%} relative error) is usually obtained for the matrix element, while in most cases, for the remainder of the components in the sample (major, minor or trace composition), the results can only be considered semi-quantitative (<200{\%} relative error).},

This delivered the ablation laser light pulse and a buffer gas flow to the sample surface, and collected the light emitted by the micro-plasma for analysis. No distil optics were used at the sample end of the fibre. Argon, nitrogen and compressed air were used as buffer gases; while the rare gas resulted in slightly better signal-to-noise ratios, most analytical measurements were carried out with nitrogen for convenience and to provide comparability with in-air measurements. Detection limits and reproducibility were comparable to those achieved for the same samples placed in standard ambient air, with all other experimental conditions unchanged. In standard steel samples, detection limits of 31045, 32548 and 45555 ppm for Cr, Mn and Si, respectively, could be achieved. Pattern recognition algorithms were used to identify, for classification, spectra of specimen submerged in turbid and non-transparent liquids.},

abstract = {The temporal evolution of the Si atomic emission signal produced from individual silica microspheres in an aerosolized air stream was investigated using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). Specifically, the temporal evolution of Si emission from 2.47 and 4.09-micrometer-sized particles is evaluated over discrete delay times ranging from 15 to 70 µs following plasma initiation. The analyte signal profile from the microspheres, taken as the silicon atomic emission peak-to-continuum ratio, was observed to follow the same profile of silicon-rich nanoparticles over the range of delay times. The ratio of analyte signals for the 2.47 and 4.09-micrometer particles was observed to be approximately constant with plasma decay time and less than the expected mass ratio, leading to the conclusion that further vaporization and enhanced analyte response do not continue with increasing delay times for these microsphere sizes. While recent research suggests that the temporal component of analyte response is important for quantitative LIBS analysis, the current study does confirm earlier research demonstrating an upper size limit for quantitative aerosol particle analysis in the diameter range of 2 to 2.5 µm for silica microspheres.},

abstract = {A review of recent results on stand-off Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) analysis and applications is presented. Stand-off LIBS was suggested for elemental analysis of materials located in environments where any physical access was not possible but optical access could be envisaged. This review only refers to the use of the open-path LIBS configuration in which the laser beam and the returning plasma light are transmitted through the atmosphere. It does not present the results obtained with a transportation of the laser pulses to the target through an optical fiber. Open-path stand-off LIBS has mainly been used with nanosecond laser pulses for solid sample analysis at distances of tens of meters. Liquid samples have also been analyzed at distances of a few meters. The distances achievable depend on many parameters including the laser characteristics (pulse energy and power, beam divergence, spatial profile) and the optical system used to focus the pulses at a distance. A large variety of laser focusing systems have been employed for stand-off analysis comprising refracting or reflecting telescope. Efficient collection of the plasma light is also needed to obtain analytically useful signals. For stand-off LIBS analysis, a lens or a mirror is required to increase the solid angle over which the plasma light can be collected. The light collection device can be either at an angle from the laser beam path or collinear with the optical axis of the system used to focus the laser pulses on the target surface. These different configurations have been used depending on the application such as rapid sorting of metal samples, identification of material in nuclear industry, process control and monitoring in metallurgical industry, applications in future planetary missions, detection of environmental contamination or cleaning of objects of cultural heritage. Recent stand-off analyses of metal samples have been reported using femtosecond laser pulses to extend LIBS capabilities to very long distances. The high-power densities achievable with these laser pulses can also induce self-guided filaments in the atmosphere which produce LIBS excitation of a sample. The first results obtained with remote filament-induced breakdown spectroscopy predict sample analysis at kilometer ranges.},

The measurement of absorption spectra of solid samples, powders, and liquids is demonstrated using various optical setups. One of the sources we used is a widely tunable coherent THz-wave generator relying on an optical parametric process: nanosecond Q-switched Nd : YAG laser light scattering from the polariton mode of a MgO-doped LiNbO3 crystal. For the measurement of the absorption of THz waves in liquids, a train of waves is allowed to oscillate inside a silicon prism. A liquid placed on a total internal reflection surface lowers the quality factor of the resonator, which allows determining the complex refraction index of the sample by frequency scanning. We have also developed a technique for THz chemical imaging, by introducing the component spatial pattern analysis. The spatial distribution of the chemicals, such as illicit drugs concealed in an envelope, is obtained from terahertz multispectral transillumination images and absorption spectra. To compensate for the low imaging speed, a prescreening step is proposed, by first detecting the presence of powders in the envelopes, which is achieved by measuring in real time the amount of scattering produced by the envelopes. Details and examples are provided.},

abstract = {The species composition of microbial communities in natural habitats may be extremely complex and therefore a quantitative analysis of the fraction each species contributes to the consortium has proven to be difficult. During recent years, the identification of bacterial pure cultures based on their infrared spectra has been established. Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy now proceeds a step further and allows identification of microorganisms directly plated from community dilutions. Infrared spectra of microcolonies of 70-250 microm in diameter can be recorded without producing a pure culture of the isolate. We have applied this novel technique for quantitative comparative analysis of two undefined, geographically separated food-borne smear cheese microbial consortia of limited complexity. Due to the high degree of automation, up to 200 microcolonies could be identified in 1 day and, in total, 3170 infrared spectra of microcolonies were recorded. The results obtained have been verified by Fourier-transform infrared macrospectroscopy and 16S rDNA sequencing. Interestingly, although the communities were unrelated, Staphylococcus equorum, Corynebacterium casei, Arthrobacter casei and Brevibacterium linens were found to be part of both consortia, however, with different incidence. In addition, Corynebacterium variabile, Microbacterium gubbeenense, Brachybacterium alimentarium, Enterococcus faecalis and an unknown species were detected in either one of the consortia.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to provide a procedure to determine time-resolved electron temperatures with minimized relative errors by the Boltzmann plot method. The applied procedure consists of two parts, a systematic theoretical spectral line selection and an iterative Boltzmann plot algorithm. After a pre-selection of an appropriate non-disturbed or overlapped set of spectral lines of a particular atomic or ionic species Boltzmann plots are generated using experimentally recorded data for every time window and laser pulse energy of interest. Spectral lines with the highest average deviations from the regression function are assumed as being not representative for the considered ensemble of spectral lines and are therefore discarded gradually until a threshold value for the coefficient of determination is exceeded. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is applied for time-resolved and spatially integrated investigations of plasmas on 1.1750 C75 steel alloy samples with laser pulse energies ranging between 200 $\mu$J and 2 mJ. For the specific chemical composition ofthese samples a selection of atomic and ionic Fe spectral lines has been carried out. In spite of the fact that onlylaser pulse energies in the low millijoule regime are applied the final sets of spectral lines comprise in total 61Fe I and 12 Fe II emission lines. By applying this method electron temperatures can be determined withaveraged relative errors of down to 1.8{\%} for Fe I and 4.4{\%} for Fe II emission lines.},

abstract = {Highly toxic contaminants like Cr, As, and Pb were detected in chrome-tanning process of animal skin to produce leather by applying locally developed laser-induced breakdown spectrometer. An Nd-YAG laser with 1,064nm wavelength was focused on the surface of leather samples (natural and manufactured) to generate a plasma spark and spectrally resolved spectra were used for identification and quantification of contaminants. The leather samples were collected from a tannery located in industrial cities of Riyadh and Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The study was carried out on fully, half manufactured (wet blue leather), and natural hide (skin). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt where laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique has been applied for the analysis of leather before and after tanning process. The maximum concentration of different elements of environmental significance like chromium, lead, arsenic, sulfur, magnesium were 199, 289, 31, 38, and 39ppm, respectively, in one of the manufactured leather samples. The limit of detection (LOD) of our LIBS system for chromium, lead, arsenic, sulfur, and magnesium were 2, 3, 1.5,7, and 3ppm, respectively. The safe permissible limit for tanned leather for highly toxic elements like chromium, lead, and arsenic are 1, 0.5, 0.01ppm, respectively, as prescribed in Environmental Regulation Standards for Saudi Industries set by Royal Commission Jubail, Saudi Arabia. The LIBS technique is superior to other conventional techniques like ICP or atomic absorption that a little or no sample preparation is required, no chemicals are needed, multi-elemental analysis is possible for all kinds of samples (natural and anthropogenic materials), microgram of sample is essential, and LIBS could be applied for remote analysis. It is highly selective and sensitivity higher than ICP, and as no sample and chemicals are required, it is cost effective for multi-sample analysis per unit time as compared with other conventional techniques. The concentration of some toxic elements (Cr, Pb, As) is much higher than the safe permissible limits set by Occupational Safety and Health Administration in USA or Saudi environmental regulatory agencies. Results obtained with our LIBS systems were in close agreement with the results obtained using other standard analytical technique such as the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) combined with partial least squares (PLS) analysis has been applied for the quantitative analysis of the ash content of coal in this paper. The multivariate analysis method was employed to extract coal ash content information from LIBS spectra rather than from the concentrations of the main ash-forming elements. In order to construct a rigorous partial least squares regression model and reduce the calculation time, different spectral range data were used to construct partial least squares regression models, and then the performances of these models were compared in terms of the correlation coefficients of calibration and validation and the root mean square errors of calibration and cross-validation. Afterwards, the prediction accuracy, reproducibility, and the limit of detection of the partial least squares regression model were validated with independent laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy measurements of four unknown samples. The results show that a good agreement is observed between the ash content provided by thermo-gravimetric analyzer and the LIBS measurements coupled to the PLS regression model for the unknown samples. The feasibility of extracting coal ash content from LIBS spectra is approved. It is also confirmed that this technique has good potential for quantitative analysis of the ash content of coal.},

In this study, we combined the 2 modalities to survey the GI tract of a variety of mouse strains and ages and to sample dysplasias and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the intestines. Segments (length, 2.5 cm) of duodenum and lower colon and the entire esophagus were imaged ex-vivo with combined OCT and LIE We evaluated 30 normal mice (A/J and 10- and 21-wk-old and retired breeder C57BL/6J) and 10 mice each of 2 strains modeling colon cancer and IBD (Apc(Min) and IL2-deficient mice, respectively). Histology was used to classify tissue regions as normal, Peyer patch, dysplasia, adenoma, or IBD. Features in corresponding OCT images were analyzed. Spectra from each category were averaged and compared via Student t tests. OCT provided structural information that led to identification of the imaging characteristics of healthy mouse GI. With histology as the 'gold standard,' we developed preliminary image criteria for early disease in the form of adenomas, dysplasias, and IBD. LIF characterized the endogenous fluorescence of mouse GI tract, with spectral features corresponding to collagen, NADH, and hemoglobin. In the IBD sample, LIF emission spectra displayed potentially diagnostic peaks at 635 and 670 nm, which we attributed to increased porphyrin production by bacteria associated with IBD. OCT and LIF appear to be useful and complementary modalities for ex vivo imaging of mouse GI tissues.},

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was employed for the in situ analysis of pigments used in painting. LIBS spectra were collected from a wide variety of pigments in powder form and in oil color test samples. Appropriate emission lines for the identi - cation of the metallic elements in the pigments examined are pro- posed. Under optimal experimental parameters, the technique is minimally destructive; two pulses from a laser beam focused on the sample surface result in the formation of a small crater with typical diameter around 40 m m and depth of no more than 10 m m. Fur- thermore, recording LIBS spectra from successive laser pulses on the same spot of a model oil painting resulted in information re- garding the pigment composition of several paint layers, showing the capability of the technique in performing depth pro le analysis. Finally, a test case is presented in which an 18th century oil paint- ing, subjected to partial restoration, was examined by LIBS, and the different pigments used in the original and in the restored part of the work were clearly identi ed. The results of our studies dem- onstrate the applicability of LIBS in the rapid, in situ, and practi- cally nondestructive determination of pigments in painted artworks.

The effects of self-absorption on the measured line broadenings are discussed in detail. In particular, the experimental results evidence that self-absorption is much higher in laser-induced plasmas generated with double pulses, compared to the case of single pulse.

The results obtained for singly ionized Mn lines are compared with the theoretical and experimental data present in the literature.

abstract = {Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy ($\mu$XRF), and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are compared in terms of discrimination power for a glass sample set consisting of 41 fragments. Excellent discrimination results (N99{\%} discrimination) were obtained for each of the methods. In addition, all three analytical methods produced very similar discrimination results in terms of the number of pairs found to be indistinguishable. The small number of indistinguishable pairs that were identified all originated from the same vehicle. The results also show a strong correlation between the data generated from the use of $\mu$XRF and LA-ICP-MS, when comparing $\mu$XRF strontium intensities to LA-ICP-MS strontium concentrations. A 266 nm laser was utilized for all LIBS analyses, which provided excellent precision (b10{\%} RSD for all elements and b10{\%} RSD for all ratios, N=5). The paper also presents a thorough data analysis review for forensic glass examinations by LIBS and suggests several element ratios that provide accurate discrimination results related to the LIBS system used for this study. Different combinations of 10 ratios were used for discrimination, all of which assisted with eliminating Type I errors (false exclusions) and reducing Type II errors (false inclusions). The results demonstrate that the LIBS experimental setup described, when combined with a comprehensive data analysis protocol, provides comparable discrimination when compared to LA-ICP-MS and $\mu$XRF for the application of forensic glass examinations. Given the many advantages that LIBS offers, most notably reduced complexity and reduced cost of the instrumentation, LIBS is a viable alternative to LA-ICP-MS and $\mu$XRF for use in the forensic laboratory.},

This emergent technique promises applications with expected outcomes in food security or nutrition quality, as well as environment pollution detection. Characterization of the plasma induced on such soft and humid materials represents the first step towards quantitative measurement using this technique. In this paper, we present the experimental setup and protocol that optimize the plasma generation on fresh vegetables, potatoes for instance. The temporal evolution of the plasma properties are investigated using time-resolved laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). In particular, the electron density and the temperatures of the plasma are reported as functions of its decay time. The temperatures are evaluated from the well known Boltzmann and Saha-Boltzmann plot methods. These temperatures are further compared to that of the typical molecular species, CN, for laser-induced plasma from plant materials. This comparison validates the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the specific case of fresh vegetables ablated in the typical LIBS conditions. A study of the temporal evolution of the signal to noise ratio also provides practical indications for an optimized detection of trace elements. We demonstrate finally that, under certain conditions, the calibration-free LIBS procedure can be applied to determine the concentrations of trace elements in fresh vegetables.},

The curvature dependence of the 10 surface tension is interpolated by a quadratic polynomial over the nano-sized droplets and the limiting case of a planar interface, so that the so-called Aitken mode particles which are critical for droplet formation could be covered and the K¨ ohler equation could be improved by incorporating surface tension corrections.},

abstract = {The use of high intensity ultrashort pulsed laser radiation to produce optical breakdown is an important approach for the surgical treatment of intraocular structures. We have investigated the transient properties of Nd:YAG laser induced breakdown in a saline model using time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Spatially resolved pump and probe techniques are applied to study the dynamic behavior of the plasma formation, acoustic wave generation, and cavitation processes which accompany the optical breakdown. Measurements of plasma shielding and luminescence indicate that the laser induced plasma forms on a subnanosecond time scale and has a lifetime of several nanoseconds. An acoustic transient is generated at the breakdown site and propagates spherically outward with an initial hypersonic velocity, then loses energy and propagates at sound velocity. Transient heating following the plasma formation produces a liquid-gas phase change and gives rise to cavitation or gas bubble formation. This gas bubble expands rapidly for several microseconds, then slows to reach its maximum size and finally collapses.},

abstract = {A systematic study of the processes associated with mercury atomic emission in a laser-induced plasma and the interactions of mercury with oxygen species is presented. At early plasma decay times, on the order of 510 s, no significant variation in mercury atomic emission was observed with the addition of oxygen-containing species. At intermediate and long decay times {\v{Z}}10100 s., a significant reduction in the 253.7-nm mercury emission intensity was recorded with the introduction of oxygen-containing species. The decrease in mercury emission was temporally coincident with the recombination of atomic oxygen, as measured by the O{\v{Z}}I. emission. The decreased mercury emission was not due to thermal effects, based on plasma temperature measurements, and was independent of the molecular source of oxygen, for similar concentrations of oxygen as air, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Analysis of additional mercury atomic emission lines revealed that the reduction in mercury emission in the presence of oxygen species is limited primarily to the 253.7-nm transition. In concert, the data lead to the conclusion that the 253.7-nm mercury emission line is selectively quenched by oxygen species, primarily O2 and NO, that are formed during the plasma recombination process. Implications for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy-based emissions monitoring of mercury species are discussed.  2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

A principal components analysis illustrates that linear combinations of the detected atomic lines, which are present in different ratios in each of the samples tested, can be used to discriminate biological agent simulants from other biological matter. A more sensitive, narrowband LIBS instrument was used to demonstrate the detection of single simulant (Bg) particles in the size range 1–5 mm. Ca, Mg, and Na, which are present in varying concentrations between 0.3 and 11{\%} (by mass) in the Bg particles, were observed in single particles using LIBS.

Identification of trace elements in their composition allows valuable information to be obtained about alimentary habits and community life conditions of groups and individuals. Conventional methods used to determine the presence of trace elements require sample preparation, with partial or total destruction of the pieces, which in most cases are unique. In this work we show the possibilities of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) as a nearly nondestructive tool in anthropology and paleontology for the measurement of the presence and distribution of trace elements in teeth. We applied LIBS to the determination of strontium and magnesium in dentin and enamel of Neolithic, middle age, and modern Homo sapiens teeth. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca distribution maps of dentin and enamel in modern teeth were created using the data obtained. Ablation threshold fluences of dentin and enamel were also measured using the photoacoustic signal induced by laser ablation. Significant variations were found in the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios in the tooth dental tissue and between the teeth of the groups and individuals studied. These results can be useful for evolutionary anthropology studies as they can provide information regarding early nutrition, seasonality, and residential mobility.},

The assigned spectral information was selected to construct an image of 100 100 pixels by mapping the measured emission intensity values from the analyzed points. The time required for image construction and image sharpness depends on the number of laser shots per point of analysis and the number of analyzed points per image. A clear image of a copper conductor pattern from a printed circuit board was generated. In addition, some copper contaminations around the conductor area are clearly visible in the scanning LIBS map. The contaminated copper salt probably resulted from the incomplete washing step during manufacturing that could cause a short circuit in an electronic device.},

Both the elemental composition and the mineralogical classification are important in the characterisation of an ore body for commercial exploitation. Mining industry laboratories typically analyse large numbers of samples from both exploration and mine production environments. At CSIRO we have explored the application of chemometric methods of analysis in combination with laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in order to produce routine quantitative analysis of several ore types including iron, nickel and lead/zinc ores. In particular, principal components regression (PCR) has been applied to perform multi-element analysis of iron ore samples from Australia and West Africa. Calibration models for iron (4.8{\%} Av. Relative Error), aluminium (2.2{\%}), silicon (3.7{\%}) and potassium (1.4{\%}) were determined for the Australian ores. In addition phosphorous measurements were made at trace level for samples from West Africa (5.5{\%} Av. Relative Error). LIBS measurements of segments of a nickel drill core were also analysed using PCR. Mineralogical classification using a combination of LIBS and principal components analysis (PCA) has also been explored. Broad discrimination of ore mineralogy was demonstrated on the basis of the PCA of LIBS spectra in selected emission wavelength bands. The combination of PCA and PCR offers potential for both broad mineralogical and elemental analysis for the minerals industry in exploration and in mine production for the on-line monitoring of ore quality.},

A NdratioYAG laser beam (small lambda=1064nm, 30mJpulse-1) has been used for generation of laser-induced plasma on sample surface under reduced pressure of argon atmosphere. A series of starch powder samples containing different concentrations of Sr, Mg, Al, Cu, Cr, K, Mn, Rb, Cd, and Pb were used to construct the calibration curves and estimate detection limits of measurements. The calibration graphs for all elements show good linearity (correlation coefficient, r>0.99) in the range 0-160micro signgg-1 or within three orders of magnitude. Detection limits achieved were below 18micro signgg-1 for all elements studied in this work. The lowest detection limit (0.3micro signgg-1) was obtained from Sr measurement. Precision ({\%}RSD) for the selected analysis was in the range 2-10{\%}. The standard addition method was applied to assess the accuracy of LIBS using a NIES standard rice sample. The concentrations of Mg and Mn in NIES standard rice sample determined by spatially resolved LIBS technique have good agreements with those of certified value within an error range. The results indicate that spatially resolved LIBS has been shown to be an accurate technique for determining trace elements of ppm (micro signgg-1) level in starch-based food samples directly with an acceptable precision without any tedious digestion and dilution procedure.},

The signal intensity of the carbon line (247.86 nm) decreases with increasing pressure. As the plasma size strongly decreases with pressure, two collection optical setups are used, showing different raw results. To take into account the plasma size evolution with pressure, calculated corrections are applied to the collected light intensity. Carbon line emission is measured and corrected as a function of pressure in both gases. At 1 atm, the emission line is found to be greater in helium than in nitrogen by a factor of approximately 3, whereas the intensities in the two gases become close to each other at 80 atm.},

In this paper, three new Multivariate Analysis techniques are employed to analyze the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy spectra of 18 disparate igneous and highly-metamorphosed rock samples. Partial Least Squares analysis is used to generate a calibration model from which unknown samples can be analyzed. Principal Components Analysis and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy are employed to generate a model and predict the rock type of the samples.

The illicit export of coltan ore from the Democratic Republic of the Congo is thought to be responsible for financing the ongoing civil conflicts in this region. Determining the chemical composition of an ore is one of the means of ascertaining its provenance. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) offers a means of rapidly distinguishing different geographic sources for a mineral because the LIBS plasma emission spectrum provides the complete chemical composition (i.e., "chemical fingerprint") of any material in real time. To test this idea for columbite-tantalite, three sample sets were analyzed. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) allows correct sample-level geographic discrimination at a success rate exceeding 90{\%}.},

abstract = {A laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analog of a dual beam spectrometer is described and applied to the determination of trace components present in aqueous samples. It is shown that the complexity of such an instrument can be greatly reduced by using a single imaging spectrograph and two-dimensional detector to record the LIBS spectrum from the analyte and reference channels simultaneously. Implementation of the dual beam technique results in substantial spectral simplification and corresponding lower detection limits in LIBS analysis of liquids.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the effect that adverse environmental and metabolic stresses have on the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) identification of bacterial specimens. Single-pulse LIBS spectra were acquired from a non-pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli cultured in two different nutrient media: a trypticase soy agar and a MacConkey agar with a 0.01{\%} concentration of deoxycholate. A chemometric discriminant function analysis showed that the LIBS spectra acquired from bacteria grown in these two media were indistinguishable and easily discriminated from spectra acquired from two other non-pathogenic E. coli strains. LIBS spectra were obtained from specimens of a nonpathogenic E. coli strain and an avirulent derivative of the pathogen Streptococcus viridans in three different metabolic situations: live bacteria reproducing in the log-phase, bacteria inactivated on an abiotic surface by exposure to bactericidal ultraviolet irradiation, and bacteria killed via autoclaving. All bacteria were correctly identified regardless of their metabolic state. This successful identification suggests the possibility of testing specimens that have been rendered safe for handling prior to LIBS identification. This would greatly enhance personnel safety and lower the cost of a LIBS-based diagnostic test. LIBS spectra were obtained from pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria that were deprived of nutrition for a period of time ranging from one day to nine days by deposition on an abiotic surface at room temperature. All specimens were successfully classified by species regardless of the duration of nutrient deprivation.},

abstract = {An intensive multi-disciplinary research effort is underway at Wayne State University to synthesize and characterize magnetic nanoparticles in a biocompatible matrix for biomedical applications. The particular system being studied consists of 3-10 nm gamma-Fe2O3 nanoparticles in an alginate matrix, which is being studied for applications in targeted drug delivery, as a magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent, and for hyperthermic treatments of malignant tumors. In the present work we report on our efforts to determine if laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) can offer a more accurate and substantially faster determination of iron content in such nanoparticle-containing materials than competing technologies such as inductively-coupled plasma (ICP). Standardized samples of alpha-Fe2O3 nanoparticles (5-25 nm diameter) and silver micropowder (2-3.5 mu m diameter) were created with thirteen precisely known concentrations and pressed hydraulically to create solid "pellets" for LIBS analysis. The ratio of the intensity of an Fe(I) emission line at 37 1.994 nm to that of an Ag(I) line at 328.069 nm was used to create a calibration curve exhibiting an exponential dependence on Fe mass fraction. Using this curve, an "unknown" gamma-Fe2O3/alginate/silver pellet was tested, leading to a measurement of the mass fraction of Fe in the nanoparticle/alginate matrix of 51 3 wt.{\%}, which is in very good agreement with expectations and previous determinations of its iron concentration.

Dye powders were pressed with 7800 kp/cm2 in round pellets which were ablated by exposure to KrF excimer laser radiation (248 nm) at a fluence of 100 mJ/cm2. The ablation cloud was optically activated with a XeCl excimer laser. Its fluorescence spectrum was measured and was identified as a dye vapour fluorescence spectrum by comparison to conventional dye solution and dye vapour spectra. The dye cloud is not deflected in an electric field (106 V/m). By changing the delay time between the ablation laser and the focused activation laser, the velocity distribution of the ablated dye was measured. Its maximum is at 600 m/s for PPF. Knowing the thickness of the ablated dye layer per shot (300 {\AA}) and the size of the ablation cloud (pictures of a video camera), one can estimate the maximum density of the dye in the gas pulse to be 10-5 mol/l in the range of concentration of lasing dyes. However, no lasing was observed up to now. 1992.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach of applying partial least squares method combined with a physical principle based dominant factor. The characteristic line intensity of the specific element was taken to build up the dominant factor to reflect the major elemental concentration and partial least squares (PLS) approach was then applied to further improve the model accuracy. The deviation evolution of characteristic line intensity from the ideal condition was depicted and according to the deviation understanding, efforts were taken to model the non-linear self-absorption and inter-element interference effects to improve the accuracy of dominant factor model. With a dominant factor to carry the main quantitative information, the novel multivariate model combines advantages of both the conventional univariate and PLS models and partially avoids the overuse of the unrelated noise in the spectrum for PLS application. The dominant factor makes the combination model more robust over a wide concentration range and PLS application improves the model accuracy for samples with matrices within the calibration sample set. Results show that RMSEP of the final dominant factor based PLS model decreased to 2.33{\%} from 5.25{\%} when using the conventional PLS approach with full spectral information. Furthermore, with the development in understanding the physics of the laser-induced plasma, there is potential to easily improve the accuracy of the dominant factor model as well as the proposed novel multivariate model.},

abstract = {A new calibration approach to analyze binary solid samples at the percentage level is proposed, and its application to laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is presented. The method is based on the observed dependence of the linear correlation coefficient on the analyte concentration in a binary sample. The linear correlation coefficient is calculated between spectra of a range of certified standards and the spectrum of a reference sample (the analyte in the form of a pure metal), and the resulting curve is used as a calibration curve. It was found that a quadratic function could be adequately used to fit the calibration points. The first part of this paper characterizes the proposed calibration method providing mathematical and simulational data, and also describes a possibility to extend it to multicomponent samples. In the second part, the method is successfully applied to the LIBS analysis of Cu in brass samples as well as Al, Si and Cu in aluminum alloys. The new method was found to give rise to results accurate to 1-5{\%} for major components, and usually outperformed conventional calibration in terms of both precision and accuracy.},

The atmospheric extinction of laser radiation at wavelengths commonly used in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (1064 nm and 532 nm) and of the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy plasma emission beyond 250 nm is small compared to the attenuation with range due to the inverse square law. The fundamental problem with light propagation through the atmosphere is that the atmospheric transmittance does not remain constant within the whole spectral interval, and that this variation results in a change in the spectral distribution of the light received by the detector. Knowledge of atmospheric transmittance would allow for compensation of this effect.},

abstract = {Low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS) is a promising method of applying coatings to surfaces for thermal, chemical, and mechanical protection. The deposition of coatings with superior properties requires an improved understanding of this complex spray process, including the detailed understanding of the time-temperature and chemical history to which an injected particle is exposed during its travel through the high-temperature and high-velocity plasma jet. In this paper, we report on measurements of the temperatures and velocities within the plasma in a low-pressure argon-hydrogen arcjet spray plasma being developed for mesoscale manufacturing of mechanical components. The measurements reported here make use of laser absorption, laser-induced fluorescence, and optical emission spectroscopy of the H-alpha Balmer transition in atomic hydrogen. Both the absorption and fluorescence methods take advantage of the well-known spectral line broadening of atomic hydrogen, to extract the arcjet. temperature and electron density. Jet axial velocities are measured via the time of flight, as detected by optical emission, of convected disturbances caused by intrinsic fluctuations in the arc voltage. Measurements made for various anode (nozzle) geometries indicate that relatively low (similar to1 km s(-1) mm(-1)) velocity gradients in the axial direction could be achieved with nozzles that include an expanding section of 10degrees half-angles. The measured temperatures and velocities suggest the presence of complex gas-dynamic shock structures in the arcjet plume, depending on the particular nozzle length and expansion section.

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was applied to selectively analyze the aqueous suspension of Eu2O3(s) particles in the presence of the Eu3+ aquo ion. A plasma was generated by focusing a pulsed Nd:YAG laser beam ($\lambda$ = 532 nm) into the sample. The light emission from the plasma was detected by a spectrograph equipped with a gated intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) in the wavelength range of 275-525 nm. The atomic emission intensity of the Eu2O3(s) suspension was about two orders of magnitude higher than that of the Eu3+ aquo ion. The detection limits for Eu3+(aq) and Eu2O3(s) were found to be 3.3 10-5 mol/L and 2.0 10-7 mol/L, respectively. Such a difference allows the selective determination of colloidal europium particles. This capability of LIBS was used to study the formation of Eu(OH)3(s) colloids in the aqueous Eu3+ solution by varying pH until the solubility limit was exceeded. The appraisal of the threshold pH for the solubility limit led to the determination of the solubility product of colloidal Eu(OH)3(s), which was then calculated to be log K0sp = -25.5 0.4.},

abstract = {This special issue of Pure and Applied Optics is devoted to physical optics and coherence theory in honour of Professor Emil Wolf, one of the world's most distinguished scientists in these fields, whose 75th birthday fell on 30 July last year. IMG http://ej.iop.org/images/0963-9659/7/5/001/img1.gif Professor Emil Wolf Emil Wolf was born and grew up in Prague in Czechoslovakia. Being of Jewish origin, he fled the country after it was occupied by Nazi Germany in 1939. After brief periods in Italy and France (where he worked for the Czech government in exile), he arrived in Great Britain in the summer of 1940. He resumed his education the following year at the University of Bristol, where he earned a BSc degree in mathematics in 1945. It was as a postgraduate student that he began his studies in optics, designing the aspheric corrector 1 Wolf47 . After receiving a PhD degree from Bristol in 1948, he moved with his thesis supervisor, Dr E H Linfoot, to Cambridge University as a research assistant at the university observatory. It was during this period that he made several important contributions to the diffraction theory of aberrations 2 wolf51 and to the study of the structure of optical fields in focal regions, a subject which he still continues to work on today. Also at that time his association with the exiled Hungarian scientist Professor Dennis Gabor began. Gabor, who was awarded the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physics for the invention of holography, was then at Imperial College. With the help of Gabor, Wolf obtained his next position, assistant to Nobel Laureate Max Born, who was then the Tait Professor of Mathematical Physics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. Born wanted to produce a revised English translation of his 1933 work Optik , and needed an assistant to help in this task. However, as the project progressed, the book evolved into an entirely more comprehensive and authoritative text. Since its publication in 1959 Principles of Optics by Max Born and Emil Wolf 3 bornwolf or as it is more widely known `Born and Wolf', has become one of the most widely cited books in physical science, having been reprinted 15 times, and at the time of writing, a 7th edition is under preparation for publication by Cambridge University Press. Following his years at Edinburgh (1951 - 54), from which university he received a DSc degree in 1955, Wolf was a research fellow at the University of Manchester (1954 - 59). Here Wolf published his seminal papers on coherence, a subject which he had begun investigating at Edinburgh. The theory of optical coherence, which had been largely originated by Fritz Zernike and others, was at that time a rather empirical series of formulae by which the visibility of interference fringes could be calculated. Wolf's 1955 paper 4 Wolf55 placed the theory on a firm theoretical basis, and established that the two-point correlation function IMG http://ej.iop.org/images/0963-9659/7/5/001/img2.gif obeys in free space the pair of wave equations IMG http://ej.iop.org/images/0963-9659/7/5/001/img3.gif Also while at Manchester, Wolf worked with Brian Thompson, then a PhD student (who later became Director of the Institute of Optics and Provost of the University of Rochester), to produce a well-known experimental paper 5 Thompson57 which confirmed the calculations of fringe visibilities based on Wolf and Zernicke's earlier theoretical work. In 1957 Wolf spent a sabbatical year at New York University, and in 1959 he was invited by Professor Robert Hopkins, director of the Institute of Optics, to join the faculty of the University of Rochester in New York State, where he has remained ever since, except for a year as a Guggenheim fellow at the University of California, Berkeley (1966 - 67), a year as a visiting Professor at the University of Toronto (1974 - 75) and a semester as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at the University of Central Florida (spring 1998). In recognition of his outstanding accomplishments, he was appointed to the Wilson Chair of Optical Physics at the University of Rochester in 1987. He has supervised (and continues to supervise) about 30 PhD students, including the editors of this special issue, many of whom have made contributions to this special issue, and also continues the regular academic activities of a full time professor of physics at the University of Rochester. Wolf's work at Rochester in coherence theory, a good deal of it in collaboration with Professor Leonard Mandel, led to a classic review article on the subject in 1965 6 Mandel65 . This article, which is one of the 100 most cited articles published by Reviews of Modern Physics since 1955, proved so popular that the authors decided to expand it into a full length book which finally appeared in 1995 7 mandelwolf95 . His important investigations into the foundations of radiometry and its connection with coherence theory 8 Wolf78 and into the frequency representation of stationary random fields 9 Wolf81 led to the discovery of a new mechanism by means of which the spectrum of radiation can be changed on propagation even in free space. In particular, spectral lines can be shifted independently of the relative motion of the source and the observer 10 Wolf87 . This phenomenon, which has come to be known as `the Wolf effect', and is discussed in some of the articles of this special issue, may have very profound implications in cosmology. It also has applications to such fields as optical radiometric standards, communications and remote sensing (for a recent review of this subject, see 11 Wolf96 ). Other research areas that Professor Wolf has pursued include the reconstruction of objects from diffracted and scattered light: he published the seminal paper on diffraction tomography in 1969 12 Wolf69 . He also continued his work on focused fields 13 Boivin65 , 14 Wolf97 and, with Y Li, gave the first explanation of the focal shift, by which the position of the focal spot can be displaced towards the focusing lens by diffractive effects 15 Li84 . He has also made important contributions to diffraction theory (for example the theory of the boundary diffraction wave 16 Miya the theory of non-radiating sources, phase retrieval in inverse problems and the Ewald - Oseen extinction theorem. Lack of space forbids us from citing all of his papers (over 280 at last count), so we have confined ourselves to mentioning a few representative examples of his work. Professor Wolf has been awarded five honorary doctorates, from the University of Groningen, Netherlands (1989), from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland (1990), from Palacky University, Czechoslovakia (1992), from the University of Bristol, England (1997) and from Laval University, Canada (1997). In addition he is one of eight lifetime honorary members of the Optical Society of America, of which he served as president in 1978, and which he helped save from itself when it rather pointlessly attempted to change its name in 1989. He is also a fellow of the American Physical Society, the British Institute of Physics and the Franklin Institute and an honorary member of the Optical Society of India, the Optical Society of Australia and the Czech Academy of Sciences. He has also been the Editor since its founding in 1961 of the review series Progress in Optics , which now consists of 38 volumes, and he has also received many awards for his contributions, including the Ives Medal, the highest award of the Optical Society of America. The subjects covered by the papers in this special issue, like Professor Wolf's research interests, range over a wide variety of fields. Many of the papers are written versions of talks presented at the Workshop on Physical Optics and Coherence Theory, also organized in honour of Professor Wolf, which was held at Long Beach, California, on 17 October 1997. We have arranged the papers into topical sections, as follows: coherence theory, the Wolf effect and spatial coherence spectroscopy, scattering and propagation in turbulent media, propagation in nonlinear media, propagation in dispersive media, periodicities in propagation, optical signal processing and the fractional Fourier transform, inverse problems and diffraction tomography, non-radiating sources, beam propagation and characterization and, finally, focused optical fields. In the spirit of fairness, the papers are arranged in these sections in the order in which they were received. We are sure that we express the sentiments of all our contributors and readers when we wish Emil many more years of productive research. If there were any articles which were too late for inclusion in this special issue, we are most willing to consider them for the special issue we are planning for his 100th birthday in 2022, provided the article is likely to become of equally lasting value as those of Professor Wolf! The editors would like to express their deep appreciation to Professor Mario Bertolotti, Michele Bouchareine and the editorial staff of the Journal of the European Optical Society, as well as to Tom Spicer, Elizabeth Martin and the staff of IOP Publishing for their untiring and highly professional help in preparing this special issue. This issue could not have been produced without the expert help of the various anonymous referees who reviewed the manuscripts. 1 Wolf E and Preddy W S 1947 On the determination of aspheric profiles Proc.

abstract = {The potential of a multi-pulse (MP) laser excitation scheme for deep stratigraphy of electrolytically galvanized steel using laser-induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) has been evaluated. For this purpose, a commercial electro-optically (EO) Q-switched Nd:YAG laser was employed, where by reducing the delay between the Q-switch opening and the flash lamp, a train of pulses (up to 11) separated by approximately 7.40 $\mu$s was generated during one lamp flashing. Plasma emission after each individual laser pulse of the MP sequence was detected by a spectrograph equipped with an intensified charge-coupled device (iCCD) detector. With MP excitation, the ablation efficiency was increased ten-fold on iron sample and 22.5-fold on zinc material with respect to dual-pulse or single-pulse excitation. The LIBS signal generated by MP excitation shows an analogous enhancement. Although the total energy per shot delivered to samples was only 60 mJ, it was possible using LIBS to measure the sample stratigraphy up to depths of 90 $\mu$m on zinc-coated steel sheets. A satisfactory agreement between the Zn thickness determined by the MP-LIBS system and data from the manufacturer has also been obtained.},

We also compare the use of LCTFs and acousto-optic tunable filters (AOTFs) for time-resolved plasma imaging applications in terms of resolution, out-of-band rejection, and image quality. Application of tunable filter technologies to plasma imaging is unlike other spectroscopic imaging methods because of the intense and spectrally broad background generated by a laser-induced plasma. High quality images of the distribution of atomic emission within a laser-induced plasma can be achieved using both AOTFs and LCTFs. However, additional filters are needed for rejection of wavelengths outside the tuning ranges of the devices. Both devices exhibited superior resolution in the lower working range of the filters ({\~{}}500 nm) with the LCTF exhibiting superior spectral resolution to the AOTF.},

abstract = {Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy ($\mu$XRF), and laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are compared in terms of discrimination power for a glass sample set consisting of 41 fragments. Excellent discrimination results (N99{\%} discrimination) were obtained for each of the methods. In addition, all three analytical methods produced very similar discrimination results in terms of the number of pairs found to be indistinguishable. The small number of indistinguishable pairs that were identified all originated from the same vehicle. The results also show a strong correlation between the data generated from the use of $\mu$XRF and LA-ICP-MS, when comparing $\mu$XRF strontium intensities to LA-ICP-MS strontium concentrations. A 266 nm laser was utilized for all LIBS analyses, which provided excellent precision (b10{\%} RSD for all elements and b10{\%} RSD for all ratios, N=5). The paper also presents a thorough data analysis review for forensic glass examinations by LIBS and suggests several element ratios that provide accurate discrimination results related to the LIBS system used for this study. Different combinations of 10 ratios were used for discrimination, all of which assisted with eliminating Type I errors (false exclusions) and reducing Type II errors (false inclusions). The results demonstrate that the LIBS experimental setup described, when combined with a comprehensive data analysis protocol, provides comparable discrimination when compared to LA-ICP-MS and $\mu$XRF for the application of forensic glass examinations. Given the many advantages that LIBS offers, most notably reduced complexity and reduced cost of the instrumentation, LIBS is a viable alternative to LA-ICP-MS and $\mu$XRF for use in the forensic laboratory.},

For NM the resonance enhancement enabled realistic outdoor measurements in vapor phase at 13 m distance.

Excellent discrimination was achieved with all sample types using PLS-DA and several techniques for improving sample classification were identified. The laboratory double-pulse LIBS system did not provide any advantage for sample classification over the single-pulse LIBS system, except in the case of the soil samples. The standoff LIBS system provided comparable results to the laboratory systems.

The aim of this work was to examine the possibility of quantitative determination of the niobium, titanium, tantalum and cobalt. The investigated samples were in the form of pellets, pressed with and without binder (powdered silver) and in the form of cemented tungsten carbides. The pellets were prepared by pressing the powdered material in a hydraulic press. Cemented tungsten carbides were embedded in resin for easier manipulation. Several lasers and detection systems were utilized. The Nd:YAG laser working at a basic wavelength of 1064 nm and fourth-harmonic frequency of 266 nm with a gated photomultiplier or ICCD detector HORIBA JY was used for the determination of niobium which was chosen as a model element. Different types of surrounding gases (air, He, Ar) were investigated for analysis. The ICCD detector DICAM PRO with Mechelle 7500 spectrometer with ArF laser (193 nm) and KrF laser (248 nm) were employed for the determination of niobium, titanium, tantalum and cobalt in samples under air atmosphere. Good calibration curves were obtained for Nb, Ti, and Ta (coefficients of determination r2 > 0.96). Acceptable calibration curves were acquired for the determination of cobalt (coefficient of determination r2 = 0.7994) but only for the cemented samples. In the case of powdered carbide precursors, the calibration for cobalt was found to be problematic.},

In the present paper, the applicability of LIBS for different solid samples having homogeneous (silver ornament, aluminum plate) or heterogeneous composition (soil) using nanosecond laser pulses is discussed. Nanosecond pulse laser makes plasma at the sample surface even at very low pulse energies and also allows for precise ablation of the substrate material with little damage to the surrounding area.

abstract = {The high sensitivity of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for the detection of most of the fly ash components enables the analysis of these residues produced during the combustion of coal. Fly ash consists of oxides (SiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, CaO...) and unburnt carbon which is the major determinant of combustion efficiency in coal fired boilers. For example, an excessive amount of residual carbon dispersed in the fly ash means a significant loss of energy (Styszko et al., 2004 1). Standard methods employed for the analysis of fly ash make not possible a control of boiler in real time. LIBS technique can significantly reduce the time of analysis, in some cases even an online detection can be performed. For this reason, some studies have been addressed in order to demonstrate the capability of the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy technique for the detection of carbon content in high pressure conditions typical of thermal power plants (Noda et al., 2002 2) and for the monitoring of unburnt carbon for the boiler control in real time (Kurihara et al., 20033). In particular, the content of unburnt carbon is a valuable indicator for the control of fly ash quality and for the boiler combustion. Depending on this unburnt carbon content, fly ash can be disposed as an industrial waste or as a raw material for the production of concrete in the construction sector. In this study, analyses were performed on specimens of various forms of preparation. Pressed pellets were prepared with two different binders. Presented results concern the nature and amount of the binder used to pelletize the powder, and the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy parameters and procedure required to draw calibration curves of elements from the fly ash. Analysis "on tape" was performed in order to establish the experimental conditions for the future "online analysis".},

The population-level distribution and corresponding temperature were obtained using Boltzmann plots.

The plasma under study had an electron temperature of 13,200 K and an electron number density of 2 x 10(16) cm(-3). The experimental relative transition probabilities were put on an absolute scale using the branching ratio method to calculate Sn I multiplet transition probabilities from available radiative lifetime data of their upper states and plotting the Sn I emission spectrum lines on a Boltzmann plot assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) to be valid and following Boltzmann's law. The LTE conditions and plasma homogeneity have been checked. Special attention was paid to the possible self-absorption of the different transitions.

abstract = {The problem of finding new methods for the analysis of precious alloys has stimulated, in recent years, a number of different proposals for improving the analytical procedures introducing more robust calibration (or calibration-free) methods. In the paper "Accurate quantitative analysis of gold alloys using multi-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and a correlation-based calibration method" by G. Galb{\'{a}}cs, N.Jedinski, G.Cseh, Z. Galb{\'{a}}cs and L. T{\'{u}}ri Spectrochimica Acta Part B, Volume 63, Issue 5, 591-597 (May 2008) the authors proposed the use of multiple-pulse LIBS and a correlation-based method for building calibration curves for quantitative analysis of gold alloys. The method is proposed for gold alloys prepared using a fixed proportion of the alloying element. The general case where the relative concentration of the elements of the matrix is not a priori known is not discussed in the paper. In this communication, we will demonstrate that the method proposed is extremely fragile against matrix effects, and therefore cannot be usefully applied for the purpose of actual analytical measurements on gold alloys without a previous knowledge of the matrix composition.},

The probe incorporates both single-strand optical fibers and an image guide and allows atomic emission and Raman analysis of any spot on a solid sample within a 5 mm diameter field of view. The real-time sample imaging aspects of the probe are demonstrated by measuring LIBS spectra from different regions of a granite sample and by measuring the Raman spectra of individual TiO2 and Sr(NO3)2 particles on a soil substrate. The ability to obtain remote Raman images of the TiO2 and Sr(NO3)2 particles on the soil substrate is also demonstrated.

The diverse emissions from the phosphate component at 588.1 and 588.7 nm provide a fingerprint for bacterial strains.

Recent advances in instrumentation and data analysis techniques are discussed, including the use of double-pulse LIBS to reduce air entrainment in the analytical plasma and the application of advanced chemometric techniques such as partial leastsquares discriminant analysis to discriminate between residues of explosives and non-explosives on various surfaces. A number of challenges associated with detection of explosives residues using LIBS have been identified, along with their possible solutions. Several groups have investigated methods for improving the sensitivity and selectivity of LIBS for detection of explosives, including the use of femtosecond-pulse lasers, supplemental enhancement of the laser-induced plasma emission, and complementary orthogonal techniques. Despite the associated challenges, researchers have demonstrated the tremendous potential of LIBS for real-time detection of explosives residues at standoff distances.},

abstract = {Matrix effects limit the performance of LIBS in absolute elemental analysis, since the spectral intensity of an emission line at a given concentration depends on the matrix. On the other hand, several characteristics of the plasma morphology depend on the matrix as well. Therefore, understanding the interrelation between plasma morphology and the matrix effects may result in releasing LIBS analysis from the necessity of obtaining independent information on the sample matrix. Preliminary results indicate that morphological data, which can be readily obtained, may provide the necessary information on the most important matrix characteristics, such that the proper calibration plot can be utilized for obtaining the required concentration. Moreover, once the interrelations between the matrix effects and plasma morphology have been established, one can utilize this information for performing sophisticated LIBS analysis. For example, the organic carbon content of soils can be distinguished from the total carbon, using a specific emission line, which is affected be the organic content. This way, the matrix effect is utilized for obtaining analytical information that could not be obtained by traditional LIBS.},

In particular, we address the issues associated with the picking out of bio-aerosols against common background aerosol particles, comparing laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy measurements with data from a mobile single-particle aerosol mass spectrometer (ATOFMS). The data from the latter provide statistical data over an extended period of time, highlighting the variation of the background composition. While single-particle bio-aerosols are detectable in principle, potential problems with small (similar to 1 mu m size) bio-aerosols have been identified; constituents of the air mass other than background aerosols, e.g. gaseous CO2 in conjunction with common background aerosols, may prevent unique recognition of the bio-particles. We discuss whether it is likely that laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy on its own can provide reliable, real-time identification of bio-aerosol in an urban environment, and it is suggested that more than one technique should be or would have to be used. A case for using a combination of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and Raman (and/or) laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy is made. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we analyze our experimental spectra obtained in the laboratory by three chemometric methods-principal components analysis (PCA), soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) and partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA)-to investigate the feasibility of rocks classification by remote LIBS. If PCA is very interesting for data visualization, SIMCA and PLS-DA enable the making of automatic predictions. We show that SIMCA is less sensitive than PLS-DA, but also more robust when it encounters spectra of an unknown rock.

The instrument design allows simultaneous determination of all detectable elements using a multiple spectrograph and a synchronized, multiple charge-coupled device (CCD) spectral acquisition system. The application of internal ratio analysis has enabled the development of a stable system that can be operated routinely for over a month without recalibration. Detection limits vary depending on the element but are typically on the order of 0.01{\%} by weight for heterogeneous materials such as the moist lignite used in these power stations. Independent testing of the instrument has shown good correlation between the routine LIBS analysis and the analysis of the coal via acid extraction techniques for key ash-forming elements. Testing over a one month period shows excellent correlation between the two methods for elements such as Al (R = 0.96) and Na (R = 0.92). The principle limitation is not the accuracy of the LIBS method but rather the inherent errors in sampling heterogeneous materials such as lignite. Because the LIBS analysis takes less than 30 seconds it has clear advantages over traditional methods used in elemental analysis for these materials.},

Plasma emission after each individual laser pulse of the MP sequence was detected by a spectrograph equipped with an intensified charge-coupled device (iCCD) detector. With MP excitation, the ablation efficiency was increased ten-fold on iron sample and 22.5-fold on zinc material with respect to dual-pulse or single-pulse excitation. The LIBS signal generated by MP excitation shows an analogous enhancement. Although the total energy per shot delivered to samples was only 60 mJ, it was possible using LIBS to measure the sample stratigraphy up to depths of 90 $\mu$m on zinc-coated steel sheets.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique previously used for detection of cancer in a variety of organ systems. The objective of this study was to determine whether in vivo laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy alone at the visible excitation wavelength of 410 nm could be used to detect non-melanoma skin cancers. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: The system consisted of a nitrogen/dye laser tuned at 410 nm, an optical multichannel analyzer, and a fiber optic probe for excitation of tissue and collection of fluorescence emission. Two hundred and seventy nine measurements were performed from normal and abnormal tissues in 49 patients. Patients were classified as having either skin types I, II, or III. Biopsy of the abnormal tissues were then performed. Each measurement was assigned as either normal, basal cell carcinoma (BCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), pre-cancerous, or benign. Total emission photon count was used as the discriminating index. A threshold value was calculated to separate normal tissue indices from indices of cancer tissues. The classification accuracy of each data point was determined using the threshold value. RESULTS: Cancers were classified 93, 89, and 78{\%} correctly in patients with skin types I, II, and III, respectively. Normal tissues were classified 93, 88, and 50{\%} correctly in patients with skin types I, II, and III, respectively. Using the same threshold, pre-cancerous spectra were classified 78 and 100{\%} correctly in skin types I and III, respectively. Benign lesions were classified 100, 46, and 27{\%} correctly in patient with skin types I, II, and III, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy at 410 nm excitation and using the intensity of emission signal is effective for detection of BCC, SCC, and actinic keratosis, specially in patients with light colored skin.},

abstract = {Yellow cake is a commonly used name for powdered uranium concentrate, produced with the uranium ore. It is the first step in the fabrication of nuclear fuel. As it contains fissile material its circulation needs to be controlled in order to avoid proliferation. In particular there is an interest in onsite determination of the geographical origin of a sample. The yellow cake elemental composition depends on its production site and can therefore be used to identify its origin. In this work laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) associated with chemometrics techniques is used to discriminate yellow cake samples of different geographical origin. 11 samples, one per origin, are analyzed by a commercial equipment in laboratory experimental conditions. Spectra are then processed by multivariate techniques like Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA). Successive global PCAs are first performed on the whole spectra and enable one to discriminate all samples. The method is then refined by selecting several emission lines in the spectra and by using them as input data of the chemometric treatments. With a SIMCA model applied to these data a rate of correct identification of 100{\%} is obtained for all classes. Then to define the specifications of a future onsite LIBS system, the use of a more compact spectrometer is simulated by a numerical treatment of experimental spectra. Simultaneously the reduction of spectral data used by the model is also investigated to decrease the spectral bandwidth of the measurement. The rate of correct identification remains very high. This work shows the very good ability of SIMCA associated with LIBS to discriminate yellow cake samples with a very high rate of success, in controlled laboratory conditions.},

The pulsed optoacoustic absorption measurement technique has been applied to the following linear spectroscopic studies: (1) precise measurements of the optical absorption spectra of H2O and D2O; (b) accurate determination of absorption strengths and profiles of high harmonics (n=6, 7, and 8) of vibrational modes in transparent organic liquids (e.g., benzene); (c) quantitative absorption spectra of thin 1-10 $\mu$m) liquid films; and (d) quantitative absorption spectra of solids and finely powdered crystals. The usefulness of the pulsed optoacoustic technique to nonlinear spectroscopy has been demonstrated in the following studies: (a) quantitative two-photon absorption spectroscopy of the weak two-photon (1B2$\mu$1A1g) transition in benzene; and (b) optoacoustic Raman-gain spectra for a variety of liquids where an ability to measure Raman gains as small as 10-5 cm-1 has been demonstrated.

abstract = {The analytical figure of merit of the potential of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been evaluated for detection of trace element in liquid. LIBS data of Mg, Cr, Mn, and Re were studied. Various optical geometries, which produce the laser spark in and at the liquid sample, were tested. The calibration curves for Mg, Cr, Mn, and Re were obtained at the optimized experimental conditions with bulk liquid and in liquid jet. It was found that measurements using a liquid jet provide better detection limits than bulk liquid measurements. The limits of detection (LOD) of Mg, Cr, Mn, and Re in the present liquid jet measurement are found to be 0.1, 0.4, 0.7, and 8 ppm, respectively. The LOD of Mg using Mg 279.55 nm was compared with the values found in other liquid work.},

abstract = {The ablation of brass samples in argon shield gas by 170 fs and 6 ns laser pulses has been studied by optical emission spectroscopy of the evolving plasmas. Differences observed in the temporal behavior of the spectral line intensities are explained by the shielding effect of the Ar plasma for ns-pulses and the free expansion of the plasma of the ablated material in case of fs-pulses. Brass with different Zn/Cu ratios were used as samples. Different types of crater formation mechanisms in the case of ns- and fs-pulses were observed. At 40 mbar argon pressure the thresholds of ablation were found to be {\~{}}0.1 and {\~{}}1.5 J cm-2 for fs- and ns-pulses, respectively. With an internal standardization of zinc to copper it is possible to correct for differences in the ablation rates and to obtain linear calibration curves. For optimum experimental conditions, narrower confidence intervals for the determination of unknown concentrations were found in case of fs-pulses. Within the range of the laser intensities used, no dependence of the Zn/Cu line intensity ratio on the number of laser pulses applied to the same ablation spot was observed, neither for fs- nor for ns-pulses, which is interpreted as the absence of fractional vaporization.},

abstract = {This study deals with the analysis of encrustation on marble by laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), with the aim to obtain quick in-situ information on the in-depth profiling of the encrustation before advancing to conservation treatments. The encrustation examined is formed on exposed marble: (a) as products of the interaction between the stone surface and atmospheric pollutants (dendritic black and thin black encrustation, of approximately 300 and 200 mum thicknesses, respectively); (b) from deposition of soil-dust on marble surfaces (soil-dust crust, 300 mum thick); and (c) from treatments conducted in the past for aesthetic and/or protective purposes (patina samples, 300 mum thick). The crusts examined are multilayer encrustations on un-weathered marble, as revealed by studying cross sections with optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. The elemental LIBS profiles of black encrustation based on relative spectral line intensity values show that the Fe, Si, Al and Ti content relative to Ca content decrease significantly with depth, expressing, thus, contamination decreasing within the alteration layers, since these elements originate from atmospheric pollution and deposition. In the cases of soil-dust encrustation and patina samples Si I and Al I emissions identified throughout the analyzed crust, indicate deposition of soil-dust and remnants of previous treatments, respectively. Therefore, LIBS, a micro-destructive technique can be used as an autonomous in-situ diagnostic technique to obtain in-depth elemental profiling of encrustation even in cases of highly in-homogeneous layered crusts, such those of un-weathered Pentelic marble.},

abstract = {Bacterial samples Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis have been analyzed by laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy LIBS using femtosecond pulses. We compare the obtained spectra with those resulting from the classical nanosecond LIBS. Specific features of femtosecond LIBS have been demonstrated, very attractive for analyzing biological sample: i a lower plasma temperature leading to negligible nitrogen and oxygen emissions from excited ambient air and a better contrast in detection of trace mineral species; and ii a specific ablation regime that favors intramolecular bonds emission with respect to atomic emission. A precise kinetic study of molecular band head intensities allows distinguishing the contribution of native CN bonds released by the sample from that due to carbon recombination with atmospheric nitrogen. Furthermore a sensitive detection of trace mineral elements provide specific spectral signature of different bacteria. An example is given for the Gram test provided by different magnesium emissions from Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. An entire spectrum consists of hundred resolved lines belonging to 13 atomic or molecular species, which provides an ensemble of valuable data to identify different bacteria. © 2006 American Institute of Physics},

Ninety seven biopsies from 32 patients with atypical cervical/vaginal cytology were collected. The biopsies were guided by colposcopy and taken at the squamous-columnar junction. Fluorescence emission spectra of each biopsy were collected by means of an optical fiber cable coupled to an argon laser at 488 nm as excitation source and addressed to a spectrograph and CCD camera/controller. Spectra were separated into three groups, CC, LGSIL and HGSIL, based on the cytopathology. It was detected similar mean spectra profiles for CC and LGSIL, and differences for HGSIL. An algorithm was developed for tissue classification based on the intensity of the multiplication of each spectrum by the mean spectrum of each group, searching for a discriminator that would address this spectral difference. The sensitivity and specificity of HGSIL identification, compared to CC and LGSIL was 89{\%} and 100{\%}, respectively. The LIFS using excitation wavelength of 488 nm could be used to differentiate HGSIL lesions from LGSIL and CC inflammation, and could help a precocious and less invasive diagnosis of cervix lesions.},

The atmospheric extinction of laser radiation at wavelengths commonly used in laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (1064 nm and 532 nm) and of the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy plasma emission beyond 250 nm is small compared to the attenuation with range due to the inverse square law. The fundamental problem with light propagation through the atmosphere is that the atmospheric transmittance does not remain constant within the whole spectral interval, and that this variation results in a change in the spectral distribution of the light received by the detector. Knowledge of atmospheric transmittance would allow for compensation of this effect.},

The optimization of the ablation regime in terms of laser parameters (pulse duration, wavelength, fluence) is important to generate a plasma suitable for the analysis. We first present the results of a study of laser ablation of organic samples with different laser parameters using time-resolved shadowgraph. We correlate the early stage expansion of the plasma to its optical emission properties, which allows us to choose suitable laser parameters for an efficient analysis of organic or biological samples by LIBS. As an illustration of the analytical ability of LIBS for biological materials, we show that the emission from CN molecules can be used to distinguish between biological and inorganic samples. Native CN molecular fragment directly ablated from a biological sample are identified using time-resolved LIBS. Those due to recombination with nitrogen contained in atmospheric air can be distinguished with their specific time evolution behavior.},

One or two pulsed second harmonic Nd:YAG lasers ( =532 nm) were used for the generation of laser-induced breakdown, and an intensified CCD camera, spectrometer, and optical bundle fiber were used for spectral measurement. To maximize the spectral intensity of the chlorine fluorescence line at a wavelength of 837.59 nm, the time delay between laser irradiation and spectral measurement, the time delay between the two laser pulses in double-pulse measurement, and the gate width of the spectral measurement were optimized. The linear relationship between the spectral intensity of the chlorine fluorescence line and the chlorine concentration was verified for pressed samples with chlorine concentrations from 0.18 to 5.4 kg/m3. The signal-to-noise ratio was higher than 2 for the sample with a chlorine concentration of 0.18 kg/m3 (0.008 wt. {\%}). Thus, a chlorine concentration of 0.6 kg/m3, at which the reinforcing bars in concrete structures start to corrode, can be detected.

Five elements (Al, Ca, Fe, Ni, and Si) were examined in five slurry simulants containing varying amounts of each ion. Three calibration models were developed by using univariate calibration, multiple linear regression, and partial least square regression.

However, genetic differences that explain variation in pathogenesis and whether different biotypes are associated with specific nonhuman hosts are largely unknown. In this study, we applied comparative phylogenomics (whole-genome comparisons of microbes with DNA microarrays combined with Bayesian phylogenies) to investigate a diverse collection of 94 strains of Y. enterocolitica consisting of 35 human, 35 pig, 15 sheep, and 9 cattle isolates from nonpathogenic, low-pathogenicity, and highly pathogenic biotypes. Analysis confirmed three distinct statistically supported clusters composed of a nonpathogenic clade, a low-pathogenicity clade, and a highly pathogenic clade. Genetic differences revealed 125 predicted coding sequences (CDSs) present in all highly pathogenic strains but absent from the other clades. These included several previously uncharacterized CDSs that may encode novel virulence determinants including a hemolysin, a metalloprotease, and a type III secretion effector protein. Additionally, 27 CDSs were identified which were present in all 47 low-pathogenicity strains and Y. enterocolitica 8081 but absent from all nonpathogenic 1A isolates. Analysis of the core gene set for Y. enterocolitica revealed that 20.8{\%} of the genes were shared by all of the strains, confirming this species as highly heterogeneous, adding to the case for the existence of three subspecies of Y. enterocolitica. Further analysis revealed that Y. enterocolitica does not cluster according to source (host).},

abstract = {Rapid and accurate detection and identification of biological agents is an objective of various national security programs. Detection in general is difficult owing to natural clutter and anticipated low concentrations of subject material. Typical detection architectures comprise a nonspecific trigger, a rapid identifier, and a confirming step, often in a laboratory. High-confidence identification must be made prior to taking action, though this must be traded against regrets stemming from delay. Sensing requirements are best established by positing plausible scenarios, two of which are suggested herein. Modern technologies include the use of elastic scatter and ultraviolet laser-induced fluorescence for triggering and standoff detection. Optical and nonoptical techniques are used routinely in analyzing clinical samples used to confirminfection and illness resulting from a biological attack. Today, environmental sensing serves at best as an alert to medical authorities for possible action, which would include sample collection and detailed analysis. This paper surveys the state of the art of sensing at all levels.},

abstract = {Two of the main items from which to retrieve data in anthropology are teeth and bones. Identification of trace elements in their composition allows valuable information to be obtained about alimentary habits and community life conditions of groups and individuals. Conventional methods used to determine the presence of trace elements require sample preparation, with partial or total destruction of the pieces, which in most cases are unique. In this work we show the possibilities of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) as a nearly nondestructive tool in anthropology and paleontology for the measurement of the presence and distribution of trace elements in teeth. We applied LIBS to the determination of strontium and magnesium in dentin and enamel of Neolithic, middle age, and modern Homo sapiens teeth. Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca distribution maps of dentin and enamel in modern teeth were created using the data obtained. Ablation threshold fluences of dentin and enamel were also measured using the photoacoustic signal induced by laser ablation. Significant variations were found in the Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios in the tooth dental tissue and between the teeth of the groups and individuals studied. These results can be useful for evolutionary anthropology studies as they can provide information regarding early nutrition, seasonality, and residential mobility.},

abstract = {Laser induced breakdown spectroscopy is combined with a spark discharge to operate in a laser triggered spark discharge mode. This spark discharge laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (SD-LIBS) is evaluated for Al and Cu targets in air under atmospheric pressure. Significant enhancement in the measured line intensities and the signal-to-background ratios, which depend on the spark discharge voltage and the laser fluence, is observed in spark discharge laser induced breakdown spectroscopy when compared to laser induced breakdown spectroscopy alone for similar laser conditions. The measured line intensities increase with the applied voltage for both targets, and the ratio of the measured line intensity using spark discharge laser induced breakdown spectroscopy to that using laser induced breakdown spectroscopy is found to increase as the laser fluence is decreased. For Al II 358.56, such intensity enhancement ratio increases from {\~{}}50 to {\~{}}400 as the laser fluence is decreased from 48 to 4 J/cm2 at an applied voltage of 3.5 kV. Thus, spark discharge laser induced breakdown spectroscopy allows for using laser pulses with relatively low energy to ablate the studied material, causing less ablation, and hence less damage to its surface. Moreover, applying spark discharge laser induced breakdown spectroscopy gives up to 6-fold enhancement in the S B ratio, compared to those obtained with laser induced breakdown spectroscopy for the investigated spectral emission lines.},

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is a promising technique for real-time chemical and biological warfare agent detection in the field. We have demonstrated the detection and discrimination of the biological warfare agent surrogates Bacillus subtilis (BG) (2{\%} false negatives, 0{\%} false positives) and ovalbumin (0{\%} false negatives, 1{\%} false positives) at 20 meters using standoff laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (ST-LIBS) and linear correlation. Unknown interferent samples (not included in the model), samples on different substrates, and mixtures of BG and Arizona road dust have been classified with reasonable success using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). A few of the samples tested such as the soot (not included in the model) and the 25{\%} BG:75{\%} dust mixture resulted in a significant number of false positives or false negatives, respectively. Our preliminary results indicate that while LIBS is able to discriminate biomaterials with similar elemental compositions at standoff distances based on differences in key intensity ratios, further work is needed to reduce the number of false positives/negatives by refining the PLS-DA model to include a sufficient range of material classes and carefully selecting a detection threshold. In addition, we have demonstrated that LIBS can distinguish five different organophosphate nerve agent simulants at 20 meters, despite their similar stoichiometric formulas. Finally, a combined PLS-DA model for chemical, biological, and explosives detection using a single ST-LIBS sensor has been developed in order to demonstrate the potential of standoff LIBS for universal hazardous materials detection.},

abstract = {Optimal temporal gating for laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) analysis was investigated for a select group of toxic metals, namely the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) metals arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, lead, and mercury. The differing rates of decay between the continuum plasma emission and the atomic emission were used as a means to maximize the signalto- noise ratio of the atomic emission lines for these six metal species. Detection windows were investigated corresponding to delay times from 2 to 50 m s following the plasma-initiating laser pulse. For the current experimental conditions, it is concluded that the relatively short delay time of 12 m s is optimal for the detection of arsenic, beryllium, cadmium, and mercury, while a longer delay time of 50 m s is optimal for the detection of chromium and lead. The reduced atomic emission intensity at relatively long delay times is compensated for by the use of long detector gate widths. Estimated detection limits are reported for the six metal species based on the optimized temporal gating and ensemble averaging of multiple laser pulses, and the implications for simultaneous metals monitoring are discussed.},

abstract = {A mobile Laser-Induced Breakdown Detection (LIBD) system is developed for the field study of the aquatic colloid migration. The principle of LIBD is based on the plasma generation at breakdown of colloids in the laser focus region, which is then observed by either photo-acoustic detection or optical monitoring. The method provides information on the number density and average size of colloids. The present instrumentation built up particularly for the field study is applied for the aquatic colloid migration in a natural granite fracture. The study is performed within the Colloid and Radionuclide Retention project (CRR) in order to investigate the role of colloids on the radionuclide migration, For this purpose, bentonite colloids dispersed in granite groundwater are injected into a rock fracture zone with a dipole distance of 5 m. After passing through the fracture, the groundwater is guided into a flow-through detection cell of LIBD for the quantification of colloids. Another experiment is performed with the same colloids traced by tetra- and tri-valent metal ions, Th(IV), Hf(IV) and Tb(III). The recovery of colloids as found by LIDB appears to be about 55 5{\%} of the injected colloid mass concentration, which is corroborated by ICP-MS analysis of Al present in bentonite colloids. An average size of recovered colloids is slightly decreased from the value of before injection and hence the relative number density increased in the course of the rock fracture migration. Recovered fractions of colloid-borne trace elements in the extracted groundwater are 78 8{\%} for both tetra-valent elements and 33 3{\%} for trivalent element of the originally traced concentrations. Plausible explanations are given for the different recoveries of heavy metal ions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this way, a single hybrid detection system is used to acquire the spatial, spectral and temporal characteristics of the laser induced plasma. The parallel acquisition approach of this technique ensures a much better spatial resolution in the expansion direction, reproducibility and data acquisition speed than commonly obtained by sequential measurements at different distances from the target. We have applied this technique to study the laser-induced plasma in LiNbO3 and Bi12Ge1O20, revealing phenomena not seen in such detail with standard instruments. These include extreme line broadening up to a few nanometers accompanied by self-absorption near the target surface, as well as different ablation and expansion dynamics for the different species ejected.

The information about the relationship between arsenic diffusion, arsenic concentration, and epitaxial quality resulting from Ii given RT A cycle will be useful for optimizing bipolar transistors with realigned poly silicon emitter contacts. PolycrystaUine silicon (polysilicon) films formed by low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) are widely used in advanced bipolar integrated circuit technology. When deposited directly on the single-crystal silicon, polysilicon serves as both a diffusion source and self-aligned contact to the extrinsic base and emitter regions.

For effective laser ablation of PE, we use a F2 laser (wavelength lambda = 157 nm) with a laser pulse length of 20 ns, a pulse energy up to 50 mJ, and pulse repetition rate of 10 Hz. The optical radiation of the laser-induced plasma is measured by a VUV spectrometer with detection range down to lambda = 115 nm. A gated photon-counting system is used to acquire time-resolved spectra. From LIBS measurements of certified polymer reference materials, we obtained a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 µg/g for sulphur and 215 µg/g for zinc, respectively. The VUV LIBS spectra of PE are dominated by strong emission lines of neutral and ionized carbon atoms. From time-resolved measurements of the carbon line intensities, we determine the temporal evolution of the electronic plasma temperature, Te. For this, we use Saha-Boltzmann plots with the electron density in the plasma, Ne, derived from the broadening of the hydrogen H-alpha line. With the parameters Te and Ne, we calculate the intensity ratio of the atomic sulphur and carbon lines at 180.7 nm and at 175.2 nm, respectively. The calculated intensity ratios are in good agreement with the experimentally measured results.},

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been employed for the analysis of slurry samples. Quantitative analysis of slurry samples is crucial and challenging. The problems associated with slurry samples include splashing, surface turbulence, and the difficulties of obtaining reproducible samples due to sedimentation. The LIBS analysis has achieved limited success due to inherent disadvantages when applied to slurry samples. In order to achieve improved measurement precision and accuracy, a spin-on-glass sampling method was evaluated. Five elements (Al, Ca, Fe, Ni, and Si) were examined in five slurry simulants containing varying amounts of each ion. Three calibration models were developed by using univariate calibration, multiple linear regression, and partial least square regression. LIBS analysis results obtained from the partial least square regression model were determined to be the best fit to results obtained from inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy analysis.},

@article{Moros2011,
abstract = {In general, any standoff sensor for the effective detection of explosives must meet two basic requirements: first, a capacity to detect the response generated from only a small amount of material located at a distance of several meters (high sensitivity) and second, the ability to provide easily distinguishable responses for different materials (high specificity). Raman spectroscopy and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are two analytical techniques which share similar instrumentation and, at the same time, generate complementary data. These factors have been taken into account recently for the design of sensors used in the detection of explosives. Similarly, research on the proper integration of both techniques has been around for a while. A priori, the different operational conditions required by the two techniques oblige the acquisition of the response for each sensor through sequential analysis, previously necessary to define the proper hierarchy of actuation. However, such an approach does not guarantee that Raman and LIBS responses obtained may relate to each other. Nonetheless, the possible advantages arising from the integration of the molecular and elemental spectroscopic information come with an obvious underlying requirement, simultaneous data acquisition. In the present paper, strong and weak points of Raman spectroscopy and LIBS for solving explosives detection problems, in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, and throughput, are critically examined, discussed, and compared for assessing the ensuing options on the fusion of the responses of both sensing technologies.},

Results from ore chips will be reported separately. LIBS spectral data was recorded in three separate spectral regions to measure major, minor and trace components of the iron ore sample pellets. Background stripping, normalization and spectral cleaning were applied to minimize the relative standard deviations of the LIBS data. PCR analysis was then applied to produce calibration models for iron, aluminum, silicon, manganese, potassium and phosphorous. These calibration models were then validated using independent LIBS measurements. Robust calibration models were determined for iron, aluminum, silicon and potassium, whilst the results for manganese were encouraging. Phosphorous, present at low levels in the ores measured, remained the most difficult element to determine accurately. The combination of LIBS and PCR shows potential for in-situ on-line determination of ore composition.},

abstract = {The ablation of brass samples in argon shield gas by 170 fs and 6 ns laser pulses has been studied by optical emission spectroscopy of the evolving plasmas. Differences observed in the temporal behavior of the spectral line intensities are explained by the shielding effect of the Ar plasma for ns-pulses and the free expansion of the plasma of the ablated material in case of fs-pulses. Brass with different Zn/Cu ratios were used as samples. Different types of crater formation mechanisms in the case of ns- and fs-pulses were observed. At 40 mbar argon pressure the thresholds of ablation were found to be {\~{}}0.1 and {\~{}}1.5 J cm-2 for fs- and ns-pulses, respectively. With an internal standardization of zinc to copper it is possible to correct for differences in the ablation rates and to obtain linear calibration curves. For optimum experimental conditions, narrower confidence intervals for the determination of unknown concentrations were found in case of fs-pulses. Within the range of the laser intensities used, no dependence of the Zn/Cu line intensity ratio on the number of laser pulses applied to the same ablation spot was observed, neither for fs- nor for ns-pulses, which is interpreted as the absence of fractional vaporization.},

The depth information is obtained by control of the ablation depth by adjusting the burst energy using an external electro-optical attenuator.

abstract = {The University of Salford has led the way in the fundamental research that has underpinned the development of thin film copper indium diselenide (CIS) based photovoltaics. These devices have demonstrated exceptional energy conversion efficiencies (>19{\%}) and a high tolerance to radiation damage and are thus leading researchers towards the 20{\%} efficiency barrier. Conventional CIS thin film growth processes require a post-selenisation step to incorporate Se into the as-grown material. This helps to achieve stoichometry, improves the crystallinity, controls the defect structure and also can be used to convert the semiconductor type. This paper will report the use of pulsed dc magnetron sputtering from a CIS powder target. This approach has resulted in asgrown stoichiometric thin films consisting of pinhole free, densely packed grains. An important consideration in the thin film growth of complex materials is that stoichiometry is maintained throughout the film. Conventionally, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is used to depth profile thin films but it has been reported that laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) can also be used. We will report the initial results comparing and contrasting these two techniques and show that LIBS can produce meaningful data.},

abstract = {Laser-optical measurements and fibre optics are potentially attractive tools for applications in soil science because of their great sensitivity and selectivity and their capabilities for on-line and in situ analysis. We have investigated laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) for the quantitative detection of metal ions on the surface of natural soil samples from two sites (Hohenschulen and Oderbruch, Germany). The LIBS technique allows the spatially resolved investigation of adsorption and desorption effects of ions in sail. A frequency doubled (532nm) and Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with a pulse duration of 8ns is focused on the soil surface and induces a plasma. Typical power densities are 150 mJ mm(-2). The plasma emission is recorded in time and spectrally resolved by a gateable optical multichannel analyser (OMA). A delay time of about 500 ns between laser pulse and OMA gate was used to resolve single atomic and ionic spectral lines from the intense and spectrally broad light that is emitted by the plasma itself. The dependency of the LIBS signal of a single spectral line on the amount of water in the sample is investigated in detail. The results indicate that quenching of water in the plasma plume reduces the line intensities, while the interaction with aquatic colloids increases the intensity. The two processes compete with each other, and a non-linear correlation between measured line intensities and the amount of water in the sample is obtained. This is verified by a simple computer simulation and has to be taken into account for the quantitative interpretation of LIBS signals, e.g. when absolute concentrations are estimated. In the present investigation natural calcium concentrations g kg(-1) were measured with the LIBS technique in the samples for the two test sites. In addition, measurements were made with dry and water-saturated BaCl2 mixed soil samples, and no significant difference in the detection limit for barium was obtained.},

Transparent dressings were applied to the skin of 36 AD patients and 30 healthy subjects and then transferred onto Sabouraud dextrose agar. Colonies recovered from the medium were identified by DNA sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer regions and the D1/D2 26S rRNA gene. C. diffluens and C. liquefaciens were isolated from 42{\%} (15/36) and 33{\%} (12/36) of AD patients and from 20{\%} (6/30) and 20{\%} (6/30) of healthy subjects, respectively. In addition, fungal DNA was extracted directly from the dressings and amplified in a specific nested PCR assay.

These findings show that Malassezia spp. are not the only yeasts that colonize the skin of AD patients; Cryptococcus spp. also are present in a high proportion of patients. The role of these microorganisms in AD is as yet unknown, but the current findings, in combination with previous results, indicate that C. diffluens, C. liquefaciens, M. globosa, and M. restricta together colonize the skin surface of AD patients at a high frequency.},

This emergent technique promises applications with expected outcomes in food security or nutrition quality, as well as environment pollution detection. Characterization of the plasma induced on such soft and humid materials represents the first step towards quantitative measurement using this technique. In this paper, we present the experimental setup and protocol that optimize the plasma generation on fresh vegetables, potatoes for instance. The temporal evolution of the plasma properties are investigated using time-resolved laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). In particular, the electron density and the temperatures of the plasma are reported as functions of its decay time. The temperatures are evaluated from the well known Boltzmann and Saha-Boltzmann plot methods. These temperatures are further compared to that of the typical molecular species, CN, for laser-induced plasma from plant materials. This comparison validates the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) in the specific case of fresh vegetables ablated in the typical LIBS conditions. A study of the temporal evolution of the signal to noise ratio also provides practical indications for an optimized detection of trace elements. We demonstrate finally that, under certain conditions, the calibration-free LIBS procedure can be applied to determine the concentrations of trace elements in fresh vegetables.},

abstract = {To evaluate the diagnostic merit of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in pleural effusions, we performed fiberoptic bronchoscopy in addition to thoracocentesis and closed pleural biopsy in 140 patients who were admitted for diagnostic investigation of the causes of pleural effusions. The patients were divided into subgroups based on clinical features and roentgenographic findings of chest x-ray films. In 39 patients, the pleural effusions were due to various nonneoplastic disorders and in 95 patients it was caused by malignancy. In six patients, the causes of the pleural effusions remained undetermined. A final diagnosis was made by pleural examination in 68 patients, by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 58 patients, and by either one or both in 100 patients. In 82 patients who had no hemoptysis, a final diagnosis was made by pleural examination in 57 cases and by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 11 cases only. The diagnostic yield of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (47/58) was superior to that of pleural examination (11/58) in 58 patients presenting with hemoptysis. In 74 patients who had pleural effusions as the sole roentgenographic abnormality, the final entity was established by pleural examination in 45 and by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 12. The diagnostic merit of fiberoptic bronchoscopy was significantly higher in 59 patients who had concurrent pulmonary abnormalities on their chest roentgenograms. A final diagnosis was made in 43 cases by fiberoptic bronchoscopy in comparison with 21 cases by pleural examination. For patients with unknown pleural effusions, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was more likely to yield a diagnosis than thoracocentesis with closed pleural biopsy in those who had hemoptysis or pulmonary abnormality on chest x-ray films, whereas the reverse applied when these features were absent.},

Unstained human skin samples, excised from humans undergoing biopsy examination, were irradiated with a nitrogen laser (lambda = 337 nm) for excitation of autofluorescence and a tungsten halogen lamp for the reflectance measurements. The ex vivo spectroscopic results were correlated with the histopathology images to distinguish the areas of BCC from those of the surrounding health skin. A simple spectral analysis technique was also applied for better skin diagnosis. In conclusion, it seems that LIF and reflectance spectra could be used to differentiate neoplastic from normal skin tissue using an appropriate classification model analysis.},

abstract = {Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is an advanced analytical technique for elemental determination based on direct measurement of optical emission of excited species on a laser induced plasma. In the realm of elemental analysis, LIBS has great potential to accomplish direct analysis independently of physical sample state (solid, liquid or gas). Presently, LIBS has been easily employed for qualitative analysis, nevertheless, in order to perform quantitative analysis, some effort is still required since calibration represents a difficult issue. Artificial neural network (ANN) is a machine learning paradigm inspired on biological nervous systems. Recently, ANNs have been used in many applications and its classification and prediction capabilities are especially useful for spectral analysis. In this paper an ANN was used as calibration strategy for LIBS, aiming Cu determination in soil samples. Spectra of 59 samples from a heterogenic set of reference soil samples and their respective Cu concentration were used for calibration and validation. Simple linear regression (SLR) and wrapper approach were the two strategies employed to select a set of wavelengths for ANN learning. Cross validation was applied, following ANN training, for verification of prediction accuracy. The ANN showed good efficiency for Cu predictions although the features of portable instrumentation employed. The proposed method presented a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.3爉g dm-? of Cu and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.5 for the predictions.},

Time-integrated optical spectra emitted from the laser spark have been measured and analyzed.

A vibrational temperature of approximately 10(4) K was determined according to an intensity distribution in a vibronic structure of the CN (B2Sigma(+)u-X2Sigma(+)g) violet band. For comparison, the NH3-CH4-H2-H2O mixture has been irradiated as a model of the strongly reducing version of the early earth's atmosphere. In this mixture, excited CN seems to be significantly less abundant than C2. The LIDB experiments were in the molecular gases carried out not only in the static cell but also using a large, double stream pulse jet (gas puff target) placed in the vacuum interaction chamber.

abstract = {We have observed dynamic effects of a pre-ablation spark on the signal intensity in the orthogonal dual-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. We applied pre-ablation and ablation laser pulses with significantly reduced energy for an aluminum metal in open air. Under this experimental condition, the well-known signal enhancement through the increase in ablated mass was negligible. The Al I and II emissions were investigated by both top-view and spatially-resolved side-view collection modes. In this low laser power regime, dynamic effects of a pre-ablation spark on the signal intensity were clearly revealed. The principal factor of signal enhancement is the increase in temperature. Without the mass removal enhancement, effective rarefaction leads to decrease in the Al I emission intensity and simultaneous increase in the Al II emission intensity. This is attributed to the role of Saha equilibrium. Selective prolongation of emission lifetime only for the enclosed part of the analyte plasma in the rarefied region and other fluid-dynamic effects of a pre-ablation spark have been visualized by wavelength-selected time-space correlation maps of plasma emissions.},

abstract = {Thirty-three bituminous coal samples were utilized to test the application of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy technique for coal elemental concentration measurement in the air. The heterogeneity of the samples and the pyrolysis or combustion of coal during the laser-sample interaction processes were analyzed to be the main reason for large fluctuation of detected spectra and low calibration quality. Compared with the generally applied normalization with the whole spectral area, normalization with segmental spectral area was found to largely improve the measurement precision and accuracy. The concentrations of major element C in coal were determined by a novel partial least squares (PLS) model based on dominant factor. Dominant C concentration information was taken from the carbon characteristic line intensity since it contains the most-related information, even if not accurately. This dominant factor model was further improved by inducting non-linear relation by partially modeling the inter-element interference effect. The residuals were further corrected by PLS with the full spectrum information. With the physical-principle-based dominant factor to calculate the main quantitative information and to partially explicitly include the non-linear relation, the proposed PLS model avoids the overuse of unrelated noise to some extent and becomes more robust over a wider C concentration range. Results show that RMSEP in the proposed PLS model decreased to 4.47{\%} from 5.52{\%} for the conventional PLS with full spectrum input, while R(2) remained as high as 0.999, and RMSEC{\&}P was reduced from 3.60{\%} to 2.92{\%}, showing the overall improvement of the proposed PLS model.},

abstract = {New chemical sensors are needed for both present day expeditionary oceanography and an emerging new phase involving long term in situ ocean observations. Over the past four decades, a new spectrochemical technique, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), has been under development for the identification of the elemental constituents of materials. This technique uses a laser to create a spark or plasma on a sample. The plasma emission is then analyzed with a spectrometer to determine its elemental composition. Recently, LIBS has been identified as a viable tool for in situ field measurements because it is able to analyze all forms of matter (solids, liquids, and gases), can operate in a stand-off mode, and is non-invasive and non-destructive. A marine LIBS sensor would be a useful tool for studying many environments in the ocean, especially midocean ridge hydrothermal vents where in situ measurements are difficult due to the presence of high-temperature, corrosive fluids. A feasibility assessment of oceanic LIBS in the laboratory has been initiated. A high pressure chamber was designed and built for investigating the effect of realistic ocean environments on the LIBS signal. Preliminary work shows that LIBS can successfully detect Li, Na, K, Ca, Mn, and Zn in bulk aqueous solutions at pressures up to 272 atm, making LIBS a viable technique for deep ocean chemical sensing.},

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is demonstrated as a quantitative technique for geochemical analysis. This study demonstrates the applicability of LIBS to bulk elemental analysis of igneous rock powders. LIBS spectra of 100 igneous rocks with highly varying compositions were acquired at 9 m standoff distance under Mars atmospheric conditions. LIBS spectra were modeled using partial least squares regressions to predict major element compositions. A series of comparative tests determined the most effective methodologies for pre-processing of spectral and compositional data, and choice of calibration set. In the best cases, calculated 1-sigma errors are 1.6 wt.{\%} SiO2, 1.5 wt.{\%} Al2O3, 0.4 wt.{\%} TiO2, 1.2 wt.{\%} Fe2O3T, 1.6 wt.{\%} MgO, 0.02 wt.{\%} MnO, 1.1 wt.{\%} CaO, 0.5 wt.{\%} Na2O, 0.2 wt.{\%} P2O5, and 0.4 wt.{\%} K2O, with totals near 100{\%}. The largest improvement came as a result of scaling the elemental distributions to equalize the ranges of variability. Optimal predictions for this data set were produced with calibration set compositions input as weight {\%} oxides and not atomic fractions. Predictions were also improved when calibration sets represented the smallest range of compositional variability possible, and completely encompassed the compositional range encountered. Multiple calibration sets relevant to different rock types are preferred over a single all-encompassing calibration set. Baseline removal and transforming spectral data by their first derivative do not improve predictions and can even have negative effects. These results are directly applicable to spectra that will be acquired by the ChemCam experiment on Mars Science Laboratory, but also apply more broadly to terrestrial LIBS applications.},

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been applied mainly to bulk analysis of solids, liquids, and gases and less frequently for elemental microanalysis of solid surfaces. A micro-LIBS device devoted to analysis of the distribution of elements on surfaces is described. This device offers rapid access with a 3-microm spatial resolution to the microchemical structures of both conductive and nonconductive samples. Quantitative microchemical results of applications to ceramics are reported. By the use of a time-resolved acquisition spectrum, cerium in a uranium matrix was characterized with a cerium detection limit of 1.14{\%}. Calibration curves obtained with manipulations during 1 year facilitated evaluations of reproducibility and repeatability. A 2{\%} single-shot repeatability with a calibration reproducibility of approximately 7{\%} is reported.},

The instrument has a weight of 14.6 kg, fits completely into a small suitcase (46 x 33 x 24 cm), and operates from 115 V ac. The instrument consists of a sampling probe connected to the main analysis unit by electrical and optical cabling. The hand-held probe contains a small laser to generate laser sparks on a surface and a fiber-optic cable to collect the spark light. The collected light is spectrally resolved and detected with the use of a compact spectrograph/CCD detector system. The instrument has been evaluated for the analysis of metals in the environment: Ba, Be, Pb, and Sr in soils; Pb in paint; and Be and Pb particles collected on filters. Detection limits in ppm for metals in soils were 265 (Ba), 9.3 (Be), 298 (Pb), and 42 (Sr). The detection limit for Pb in paint was 0.8{\%} (8000 ppm), corresponding to 0.052 mg/cm(2). The higher limit obtained for Pb in paint is attributed to the use of the 220.35-nm Pb(II) line instead of the stronger 405.78-nm Pb(I) line used for soils. Spectral interferences prevented use of the 405.78-nm line to determine Pb in paint. The surface detection limit for Be particles on filters was dependent on particle size and ranged from 21 to 63 ng/cm(2). The detection limit for Pb particles on filters was 5.6 mu g/cm(2).},

abstract = {We report the effectiveness of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in probing the content of pharmaceutical tablets and also investigate its feasibility for routine classification. This method is particularly beneficial in applications where its exquisite chemical specificity and suitability for remote and on site characterization significantly improves the speed and accuracy of quality control and assurance process. Our experiments reveal that in addition to the presence of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, which can be primarily attributed to the active pharmaceutical ingredients, specific inorganic atoms were also present in all the tablets. Initial attempts at classification by a ratiometric approach using oxygen (777nm) to nitrogen (742.36nm, 744.23nm and 746.83nm) compositional values yielded an optimal value at 746.83nm with the least relative standard deviation but nevertheless failed to provide an acceptable classification. To overcome this bottleneck in the detection process, two chemometric algorithms, i.e. principal component analysis (PCA) and soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA), were implemented to exploit the multivariate nature of the LIBS data demonstrating that LIBS has the potential to differentiate and discriminate among pharmaceutical tablets. We report excellent prospective classification accuracy using supervised classification via the SIMCA algorithm, demonstrating its potential for future applications in process analytical technology, especially for fast on-line process control monitoring applications in the pharmaceutical industry.},

Spores of Bacillus atrophaeous, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus stearothemophilus were introduced into an aerosol flow stream in a prescribed manner such that single-particle LIBS detection was realized. Bacillus spores were successfully detected based on the presence of the 393.4- and 396.9-nm calcium atomic emission lines. Statistical analyses based on the aerosol number density, the LIBS-based spore sampling frequency, and the distribution of the resulting calcium mass loadings support the conclusion of individual spore detection within single-shot laser-induced plasmas. The average mass loadings were in the range of 2-3 fg of calcium/Bacillus spore, which corresponds to a calcium mass percentage of approximately 0.5{\%}. While individual spores were detected based on calcium emission, the resulting Bacillus spectra were free from CN emission bands, which has implications for the detection of elemental carbon, and LIBS-based detection of single spores based on the presence of magnesium or sodium atomic emission was unsuccessful. Based on the current instrumental setup and analyses, real-time LIBS-based detection and identification of single Bacillus spores in ambient (i.e., real life) conditions appears unfeasible.},

abstract = {The University of Salford has led the way in the fundamental research that has underpinned the development of thin film copper indium diselenide (CIS) based photovoltaics. These devices have demonstrated exceptional energy conversion efficiencies (>19{\%}) and a high tolerance to radiation damage and are thus leading researchers towards the 20{\%} efficiency barrier. Conventional CIS thin film growth processes require a post-selenisation step to incorporate Se into the as-grown material. This helps to achieve stoichometry, improves the crystallinity, controls the defect structure and also can be used to convert the semiconductor type. This paper will report the use of pulsed dc magnetron sputtering from a CIS powder target. This approach has resulted in asgrown stoichiometric thin films consisting of pinhole free, densely packed grains. An important consideration in the thin film growth of complex materials is that stoichiometry is maintained throughout the film. Conventionally, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is used to depth profile thin films but it has been reported that laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) can also be used. We will report the initial results comparing and contrasting these two techniques and show that LIBS can produce meaningful data.},

abstract = {The development of a compact laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) system increases the possibilities of applying the technique in industrial arenas, field applications and process monitoring. Significant progress has been achieved in miniaturization of optical detectors and lasers, allowing portable, low-cost LIBS equipment to be devised. Conventional lasers for LIBS, like actively Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers are limited by their bulkiness, the need for a cooling system and high power consumption. The use of a miniature solid state microchip laser overcomes these drawbacks and offers further advantages of good beam quality, high pulse repetition frequency and less damage to target. In this work we studied the quantification of elemental composition of low alloy steel samples using a higher power microchip ("powerchip") laser. The possibility of real time, in situ quantification of such materials by powerchip LIBS enhances the applicability of the technique to process monitoring in the steelmaking industry. The performance of the LIBS technique based on a powerchip laser and a portable non-intensified, non-gated detector for elemental quantification is evaluated and compared to that obtained using an intensified detector. Calibrations were achieved for Cr, Mo, Ni, Mn and Si with linear regression coefficients between 0.98-0.99 and limits of detection below 100 ppm in most cases.},

abstract = {In this contribution we present the first demonstration of simultaneous use of laser sparks for engine ignition and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) measurements of in-cylinder equivalence ratios. A 1064 nm neodynium yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser beam is used with an optical spark plug to ignite a single cylinder natural gas engine. The optical emission from the combustion initiating laser spark is collected through the optical spark plug and cycle-by-cycle spectra are analyzed for H(alpha)(656 nm), O(777 nm), and N(742 nm, 744 nm, and 746 nm) neutral atomic lines. The line area ratios of H(alpha)/O(777), H(alpha)/N(746), and H(alpha)/N(tot) (where N(tot) is the sum of areas of the aforementioned N lines) are correlated with equivalence ratios measured by a wide band universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor. Experiments are performed for input laser energy levels of 21 mJ and 26 mJ, compression ratios of 9 and 11, and equivalence ratios between 0.6 and 0.95. The results show a linear correlation (R(2) > 0.99) of line intensity ratio with equivalence ratio, thereby suggesting an engine diagnostic method for cylinder resolved equivalence ratio measurements.},

@article{Jantzi2011,
abstract = {A method for the quantitative elemental analysis of surface soil samples using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was developed and applied to the analysis of bulk soil samples for discrimination between specimens. The use of a 266 nm laser for LIBS analysis is reported for the first time in forensic soil analysis. Optimization of the LIBS method is discussed, and the results compared favorably to a laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) method previously developed. Precision for both methods was <10{\%} for most elements. LIBS limits of detection were <33 ppm and bias <40{\%} for most elements. In a proof of principle study, the LIBS method successfully discriminated samples from two different sites in Dade County, FL. Analysis of variance, Tukey's post hoc test and Student's t test resulted in 100{\%} discrimination with no type I or type II errors. Principal components analysis (PCA) resulted in clear groupings of the two sites. A correct classification rate of 99.4{\%} was obtained with linear discriminant analysis using leave-one-out validation. Similar results were obtained when the same samples were analyzed by LA-ICP-MS, showing that LIBS can provide similar information to LA-ICP-MS. In a forensic sampling/spatial heterogeneity study, the variation between sites, between sub-plots, between samples and within samples was examined on three similar Dade sites. The closer the sampling locations, the closer the grouping on a PCA plot and the higher the misclassification rate. These results underscore the importance of careful sampling for geographic site characterization.},

abstract = {The University of Salford has led the way in the fundamental research that has underpinned the development of thin film copper indium diselenide (CIS) based photovoltaics. These devices have demonstrated exceptional energy conversion efficiencies (>19{\%}) and a high tolerance to radiation damage and are thus leading researchers towards the 20{\%} efficiency barrier. Conventional CIS thin film growth processes require a post-selenisation step to incorporate Se into the as-grown material. This helps to achieve stoichometry, improves the crystallinity, controls the defect structure and also can be used to convert the semiconductor type. This paper will report the use of pulsed dc magnetron sputtering from a CIS powder target. This approach has resulted in asgrown stoichiometric thin films consisting of pinhole free, densely packed grains. An important consideration in the thin film growth of complex materials is that stoichiometry is maintained throughout the film. Conventionally, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is used to depth profile thin films but it has been reported that laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) can also be used. We will report the initial results comparing and contrasting these two techniques and show that LIBS can produce meaningful data.},

For this purpose, a compact (51 x 203 x 76 mm) nanosecond Q-switched neodymium doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser (8 ns, 20 Hz, 0.01-115 mJ/pulse) was used as an irradiation source. The use of a nanosecond-gated detector sensitive between 180 and 900 nm allows the acquisition of elemental emissions in LIB spectroscopy and can also be employed for both LIF and time-resolved Raman spectroscopy. In this work, attention is focused on the description of the instrument and its optical components, and two examples of applications for the analysis of pigments and binding media used in works of art are presented.},

Spores of Bacillus atrophaeous, Bacillus pumilus, and Bacillus stearothemophilus were introduced into an aerosol flow stream in a prescribed manner such that single-particle LIBS detection was realized. Bacillus spores were successfully detected based on the presence of the 393.4- and 396.9-nm calcium atomic emission lines. Statistical analyses based on the aerosol number density, the LIBS-based spore sampling frequency, and the distribution of the resulting calcium mass loadings support the conclusion of individual spore detection within single-shot laser-induced plasmas. The average mass loadings were in the range of 2-3 fg of calcium/Bacillus spore, which corresponds to a calcium mass percentage of approximately 0.5{\%}. While individual spores were detected based on calcium emission, the resulting Bacillus spectra were free from CN emission bands, which has implications for the detection of elemental carbon, and LIBS-based detection of single spores based on the presence of magnesium or sodium atomic emission was unsuccessful. Based on the current instrumental setup and analyses, real-time LIBS-based detection and identification of single Bacillus spores in ambient (i.e., real life) conditions appears unfeasible.},

@article{Hahn2010,
abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has become a very popular analytical method in the last decade in view of some of its unique features such as applicability to any type of sample, practically no sample preparation, remote sensing capability, and speed of analysis. The technique has a remarkably wide applicability in many fields, and the number of applications is still growing. From an analytical point of view, the quantitative aspects of LIBS may be considered its Achilles' heel, first due to the complex nature of the laser-sample interaction processes, which depend upon both the laser characteristics and the sample material properties, and second due to the plasma-particle interaction processes, which are space and time dependent. Together, these may cause undesirable matrix effects. Ways of alleviating these problems rely upon the description of the plasma excitation-ionization processes through the use of classical equilibrium relations and therefore on the assumption that the laser-induced plasma is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). Even in this case, the transient nature of the plasma and its spatial inhomogeneity need to be considered and overcome in order to justify the theoretical assumptions made. This first article focuses on the basic diagnostics aspects and presents a review of the past and recent LIBS literature pertinent to this topic. Previous research on non-laser-based plasma literature, and the resulting knowledge, is also emphasized. The aim is, on one hand, to make the readers aware of such knowledge and on the other hand to trigger the interest of the LIBS community, as well as the larger analytical plasma community, in attempting some diagnostic approaches that have not yet been fully exploited in LIBS.},

@article{Swaminathan2008,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To measure the bias in absolute cancer survival estimates in the absence of active follow-up of cancer patients in developing countries. METHODS: Included in the study were all incident cases of the 10 most common cancers and corresponding subtypes plus all tobacco-related cancers not ranked among the top 10 that were registered in the population-based cancer registry in Chennai, India, during 1990-1999 and followed through 2001. Registered incident cases were first matched with those in the all-cause mortality database from the vital statistics division of the Corporation of Chennai. Unmatched incident cancer cases were then actively followed up to determine their survival status. Absolute survival was estimated by using an actuarial method and applying different assumptions regarding the survival status (alive/dead) of cases under passive and active follow-up. FINDINGS: Before active follow-up, matches between cases ranged from 20{\%} to 66{\%}, depending on the site of the primary tumour. Active follow-up of unmatched incident cases revealed that 15{\%} to 43{\%} had died by the end of the follow-up period, while the survival status of 4{\%} to 38{\%} remained unknown. Before active follow-up of cancer patients, 5-year absolute survival was estimated to be between 22{\%} and 47{\%} higher, than when conventional actuarial assumption methods were applied to cases that were lost to follow-up. The smallest survival estimates were obtained when cases lost to follow-up were excluded from the analysis. CONCLUSION: Under the conditions that prevail in India and other developing countries, active follow-up of cancer patients yields the most reliable estimates of cancer survival rates. Passive case follow-up alone or applying standard methods to estimate survival is likely to result in an upward bias.},

abstract = {The optical properties of laser-induced plasma generated firm solid (Al alloy) and liquid (Mn, Cr, Mg, or Ti solutions) samples expanded across an external, steady magnetic field have been studied by atomic-emission spectroscopy. Various line emissions obtained from the constituents of the Al alloy and of the aqueous solution show an enhancement in intensity in the presence of an approximately 5-kG magnetic field. The enhancement of the signal was nearly a factor of 2 for the minor constituents of the solid samples and a factor of 1.5 for the elements in liquid phase. Temporal evolution of the emission from the solid sample showed maximum enhancement in emission intensity at 3-10-micros time delay after plasma formation in the laser energy range 10-50 mJ. However, for the liquid sample the maximum signal was for a gate delay of 3-25 micros the energy range 50-200 mJ. This enhancement in the emission intensity was found to be due to an increase in effective density of the plasma as a result of magnetic confinement when the plasma cooled after expansion. This enhanced emission was due to an increase in the rate of radiative recombination in the plasma.},

Spectra were recorded by exposure of the pollen to a single laser pulse from a Nd:YAG laser (lambda = 1064 nm, Ep approximately 30 mJ). The intensities of the single-pulse laser-induced breakdown spectra fluctuated dramatically, but an internal signal calibration procedure was applied that referenced elemental line intensities to the carbon matrix of the sample (represented by molecular bands of CN and C2). This procedure allowed us to determine relative element concentration distributions for the different types of pollen. These pollens exhibited some distinct concentration variations, for both major and minor (trace) elements in the biomatrix, through which ultimately individual pollens might be identified and classified. The same pollen samples were also analyzed by Raman microscopy, which provided molecular compositional data (even with spatial resolution). These data allowed us to distinguish between biological and nonbiological specimens and to obtain additional classification information for the various pollen families, complementing the laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy measurement data.},

abstract = {The boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) synthesis, using CO2-laser vaporization of a BN target under nitrogen gas, is investigated by UV-laser induced fluorescence (LIF) of the vapor phase and UV-Rayleigh scattering (RS) of the gas-suspended nanoparticles. The LIF signal from B atoms is mainly detected in the 1.5 mm-thick region above the BN target. It originates from a boron-rich vapor region confined near the hot boron droplet formed at the target surface. Then, recombination between hot boron and N2 gas occurs through a fast condensation process as revealed by both the depletion of B atoms from the vapor phase and the RS signal arising from the grown BN nanoparticles. Fluorescence spectra exhibit a strong peak at 250 nm due to boron fluorescence and mainly to nanoparticles Rayleigh scattering. A narrow peak is observed at 210 nm and a broader peak at 189 nm. These bands are tentatively assigned to fluorescence or photoluminescence (PL) from gaseous or solid BN species respectively since both gas and solid phases coexist in the plume due to the rapid cooling process. Two very weak bands occur at 308 nm and 350 nm. They are related to PL of defects bands from BN nanostructures on the basis of ex situ PL spectra of h-BN crystallites and multi-wall BNNTs. Detection of oxygen impurities is shown feasible through LIF from BO radical which is detected just above the BN target evaporated under vacuum pressure (approximately 1 mbar). An optical diagnostic strategy is demonstrated from these first in situ observations during BNNTs synthesis.},

abstract = {The present paper describes a new method utilizing rapid anodization to quickly synthesize high-quality, high aspect ratio, robust titanium dioxide nanotube powders. TiO(2) nanotube powders, With a typical nanotube outer diameter of approximately 40 nm, wall thickness of approximately 8-15 nm, and length of about 10-35 mu m, were synthesized by potentiostatic rapid breakdown anodization of titanium foils in aqueous electrolytes of 0.3 M NaCl or 0.1 M HClO(4) under an applied potential of 20 V. High reactivity and ultrahigh reaction rate are cornerstones responsible for periodic release of TiO(2) nanotubes into solution and formation of a white precipitate of TiO(2), nanotubes. The reaction yield is approximately 4-6 g in less than 3 h, and the approximate cost of the material is {\$}3.50/g, based on the laboratory-scale production. Various characterization techniques, including FESEM, HRTEM, EDX, XRD, XPS, FT-IR, UV-visible diffuse-reflectance, and NZ adsorption, have been used to probe morphology, microstructure, crystallographic, composition, bond configuration, optical properties, and surface area of the nanotubes. XPS and EDX investigations show that nanotubes formed in NaCl/phosphate electrolyte solutions contain a significant amount of phosphorus species, which strongly affects crystallization and phase transformation of TiO(2). Namely, phosphate-incorporating nanotubes stabilized the anatase phase, and initiation of the rutile phase was observed at annealing temperatures 700 degrees C. The resulting nanotube powders have a significant level of OH groups with a band gap ranging from 3.04 to 3.23 eV. Our results indicate that rapid breakdown anodization is highly efficient in the production of good-quality TiO(2) nanotube powders, which makes it an alternative to well-documented conventional methods.},

abstract = {A fiber optic FO laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy LIBS sensor that measures the on-line, in situ elemental composition of a molten alloy inside the melt in a furnace is described. This sensor has applications as a process monitor and control tool for glass, aluminum, and steel melters. The sensor is based on the transmission of laser energy through a multimode optical fiber. The laser radiation from the fiber is collimated and finally focused inside the aluminum melt in the furnace by a specially designed stainless steel holder that holds the collimating and focusing lens. Atomic emission from sparks from the laser plasma is collected by the same stainless steel lens holder and transmitted back through the optical fiber and finally fed into the entrance slit of the spectrograph. The present design of the stainless steel holder is useful for obtaining a collimated LIBS signal over a long distance the distance between the focusing and collimated lenses is more than 200 cm. Parametric studies such as sample-to-lens distance and the effect of the angle of incidence of the laser beam on the sample surface were performed. Calibration curves for minor elements were obtained for solid Al alloys as well as for a molten Al alloy in the laboratory furnace by inserting the FO LIBS probe inside the molten material. The performance of the probe was also tested by inserting the stainless steel holder into the melt at a 45 angle, which is necessary for collecting LIBS data in an industrial furnace. LIBS spectra in different spectral regions were recorded in the pilot furnace during different tests where known amounts of minor elements were added to the melt. The results obtained from this sensor for different Al alloys demonstrate the usefulness of this sensor to monitor the concentration of different constituents of the molten Al alloy in an industrial furnace.},

Then, the development of a mobile LIBS system dedicated to the in-situ analysis of soils polluted by heavy metals is described. Based on the use of ten-meter long optical fibers, the mobile system allows deported measurements.

abstract = {The present work describes the first quantitative molecular prediction using laser-induced molecular bands along with chemometrics. In addition, this spectroscopic procedure has demonstrated the first complete quantitative analysis utilizing traditionally insensitive elements for pharmaceutical formulations. Atomic LIBS requires certain sensitive elements, such as Cl, F, Br, S and P, in order to quantitate a specific organic compound in a complex matrix. Molecular LIBS has been demonstrated to be the first successful approach using atomic spectroscopy to evaluate a complex organic matrix. This procedure is also the first quantitative analysis using laser-induced molecular bands and chemometrics. We have successfully applied chemometrics to predict the formulation excipients and active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in a complex pharmaceutical formulation. Using such an approach, we demonstrate that the accuracy for the API and a formulation lubricant, magnesium stearate, have less than 4{\%} relative bias. The other formulation excipients such as Avicelregistered sign and lactose have been accurately predicted to have less than a 15{\%} relative bias. Molecular LIBS and chemometrics have provided a novel approach for the quantitative analysis of several molecules that was not technically possible with the traditional atomic LIBS procedure, that required sensitive elements to be present in both API and formulation excipients.},

The third harmonic pulse of an Nd:YAG laser is used for the generation of plasma on the molten glass surface and the plasma emission is monitored by an echelle spectrometer with an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD), which simultaneously covers the wavelength range from 200 to 780 nm. Twelve different reference HLLW glass melts with a complex composition of about 27 chemical elements are simulated on a laboratory scale, varying the HLLW component concentration. By real-time analyses of the reference glasses at 1200 C, the analytical method is calibrated. A multivariate regression approach with partial least squares (PLS) is used for the data evaluation. The LIBS method thus calibrated is then applied for the multielement analysis of molten glass samples from the prototype vitrification plant under operation in our institute. The results underline that the LIBS method can be applied to a vitrification process for the on-line multielement analysis of highly radioactive glass melts.},

Also, water can quench the laser plasma and suppress the LIBS signal, resulting in poor sensitivity. The effect of water on LIBS spectra from slurries was investigated. As the water content decreased, the LIBS signal was enhanced and the standard deviation was reduced. To improve LIBS slurry analysis, dried slurry samples prepared by applying slurry on PVC coated slides were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate calibration was performed on the LIBS spectra of the dried slurry samples for elemental analysis of Mg, Si, and Fe. Calibration results show that the dried slurry samples give a good correlation between spectral intensity and elemental concentration.},

Haemaphysalis (R.) colesbergensis adults are easily differentiated from the other species of the H. (R.) leachi subgroup, including H.

(R.) elliptica, H. (R.) moreli, and H. (R.) punctaleachi (4/4 in these species), but not from H. (R.) paraleachi, which has a 5/5 dental arrangement. However, the average total length and width of H. (R.) oliveri males (2.47 x 1.20 mm) are considerably shorter and narrower than those of H. (R.) paraleachi males (3.81 x 1.79 mm). Similar differences in size apply to the females. Nymphs and larvae of H. (R.) colesbergensis and H. (R.) oliveri can be distinguished from those of other members of the H.

Haemaphysalis (R.) colesbergensis is known only from South Africa, where it has been collected from domestic cats and dogs and medium-sized wild felids. Haemaphysalis (R.) oliveri is recorded only from Sudan, where it has been collected from small- to medium-sized wild felids and canids and an antelope. The hosts of the immature stages of H.

We present characteristics of the spectra obtained from organic samples with special attentions on the emissions of organic elements, O and N, and molecular bonds CN. The choice of these atomic or molecular species is justified on one hand, by the importance of these species to specify organic or biological materials; and on the other hand by the possible interferences with ambient air when laser ablation takes place in the atmosphere. Time-resolved LIBS was used to determine the time-evolution of line intensity emitted from these species. We demonstrate different kinetic behaviors corresponding to different origins of emitters: native atomic or molecular species directly vaporized from the sample or those generated through dissociation or recombination due to interaction between laser-induced plasma and air molecules. Our results show the ability of time-resolved UV-LIBS for detection and identification of native atomic or molecular species from an organic sample.},

Both the elemental composition and the mineralogical classification are important in the characterisation of an ore body for commercial exploitation. Mining industry laboratories typically analyse large numbers of samples from both exploration and mine production environments. At CSIRO we have explored the application of chemometric methods of analysis in combination with laser induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in order to produce routine quantitative analysis of several ore types including iron, nickel and lead/zinc ores. In particular, principal components regression (PCR) has been applied to perform multi-element analysis of iron ore samples from Australia and West Africa. Calibration models for iron (4.8{\%} Av. Relative Error), aluminium (2.2{\%}), silicon (3.7{\%}) and potassium (1.4{\%}) were determined for the Australian ores. In addition phosphorous measurements were made at trace level for samples from West Africa (5.5{\%} Av. Relative Error). LIBS measurements of segments of a nickel drill core were also analysed using PCR. Mineralogical classification using a combination of LIBS and principal components analysis (PCA) has also been explored. Broad discrimination of ore mineralogy was demonstrated on the basis of the PCA of LIBS spectra in selected emission wavelength bands. The combination of PCA and PCR offers potential for both broad mineralogical and elemental analysis for the minerals industry in exploration and in mine production for the on-line monitoring of ore quality.},

Results show that, for laser fluences above the laser-induced breakdown threshold, in all the cases studied, irradiation results in the formation of four defect-related PL bands centered on similar to1.9 (655), 2.2 (565), 2.7 (460), and 4.3 eV (290 nm). Bands centered on 1.9, 2.7, and 4.3 eV are attributed to nonbridging oxygen hole centers (1.9 eV) and oxygen-deficiency defects (2.7 and 4.3 eV). However, defects giving rise to a broad band at; 2.2 eV are unknown. For all the laser-modified samples studied, Raman spectroscopy reveals a dramatic increase in the intensity of D-1 and D-2 lines, associated with in-phase breathing motions of oxygen atoms in puckered four- and planar three-membered ring structures, respectively. This indicates laser-induced material densification. Based on these results, we discuss physical processes occurring during the catastrophic laser-induced material breakdown, leading to material densification and the formation of point defects.

abstract = {Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) has been developed as a rapid and easy in situ technique for the analysis of inorganic elements. Qualitative and quantitative determinations of an inorganic element can be achieved by analyzing the wavelength and intensity of the light emitted from the excited atoms arising from breakdown phenomena. Because the energy threshold of breakdown phenomena increases in the order of solid{\&}lt;liquid{\&}lt;gas, preferential breakdown of solid particles in liquid is possible by adjusting the energy of laser radiation. This rapid and easy in situ technique for the selective determination of soil particles or sediments suspended in water may enhance the effectiveness of environmental monitoring systems. In the present study, we applied LIBS to selective analyses of Al particles suspended in water. In addition, particle size effects that limit the performance of LIBS for the application of suspensions in the environment were investigated. Selective quantitative analysis of Al of gibbsite and alumina particles that were suspended in water was performed when the laser pulse energy was lower than that required for the breakdown of aqueous Al ions dissolved in water. When the Al concentration in the suspension was identical, the intensity of atomic emission from an Al particle increased with the particle size. This result was ascribed to the fact that larger particles contain more Al atoms per particle. There was a linear relationship between the cross-section area of the alumina particles and the intensity of the atomic emission per particle when the particles were small enough to exceed the threshold of breakdown. This suggested that both the particle size and Al concentration could be roughly estimated when simultaneous counting of the number of particles was accomplished by the use of laser-induced breakdown detection (LIBD).},

In total, 42 in-chamber Bacillus atrophaeus (formerly Bacillus subtilis var globigii; BG) cloud and 27 open-air releases of either BG, Pantoea agglomerans (formerly Erwinia herbicola; EH), MS2 and ovalbumin (OV) were generated. The clouds were refereed by different point sensors including Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) and slit or impingers samplers. The APS monitored the particle size distribution and concentration and the samplers characterized the viable portion of the cloud. The extracted spectral signatures show robustness to different degree. The correlation assessment showed good results in most cases where the LIF signal to noise ratio was significant. The sensor 4$\sigma$ sensitivity was evaluated to 1 300, 600, 100 and 30 ppl for BG, OV, MS2 and EH respectively. Correlation results are presented by plotting the SINBAHD metric versus the corresponding particle concentration, in which case, the obtained slope is proportional to the material fluorescence cross-section. The different acquired signal is hence compared in terms of their fluorescence cross-section additionally to their spectral characteristics.},

Typically LIBS is performed using nanosecond laser pulses. For this work, we have investigated the use of femtosecond laser pulses for explosive residue detection at two different fluences. Femtosecond laser pulses have previously been shown to provide several advantages for laser ablation and other LIBS applications. We have collected LIBS spectra of several bulk explosives and explosive residues at different pulse durations and energies. In contrast to previous femtosecond LIBS spectra of explosives, we have observed atomic emission peaks for the constituent elements of explosives - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen. Preliminary results indicate that several advantages attributed to femtosecond pulses are not realized at higher laser fluences.},

Industrial oxide materials from steel industry are laser ablated in air, and the optical plasma emission is collected by spectrometers and gated detectors. The temperature and electron number density of laser-induced plasma are determined from measured LIBS spectra. Emission lines of aluminium (Al), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), magnesium (Mg), silicon (Si), titanium (Ti), and chromium (Cr) of low self-absorption are selected, and the concentration of oxides CaO, Al(2)O(3), MgO, SiO(2), FeO, MnO, TiO(2), and Cr(2)O(3) is calculated by CF-LIBS analysis. For all sample materials investigated, we find good match of calculated concentration values (C (CF)) with nominal concentration values (C (N)). The relative error in oxide concentration, e (r)=C (CF)-C (N)/C (N), decreases with increasing concentration and it is e (r)100{\%} for concentration C (N)1wt.{\%}. The CF-LIBS results are stable against fluctuations of experimental parameters. The variation of laser pulse energy over a large range changes the error by less than 10{\%} for major oxides (C (N)10wt.{\%}). The results indicate that CF-LIBS method can be employed for fast and stable quantitative compositional analysis of multi-component materials.},

abstract = {We present the absolute resonance Raman scattering (RRS) intensities of uracil, rhodamine 6G (R6G), and iron(II) porphyrin with imidazole and CO ligands (FePImCO) calculated using density functional theory (DFT). The spectra are calculated using both the vibronic theory and the short-time approximation. We find that the absolute RRS intensities calculated using the short-time approximation are severely overestimated, as compared with results obtained using the vibronic theory. This issue is attributed to the sensitivity of the absolute RRS intensities to the adjustable damping factor within the short-time approximation. This is illustrated for uracil, for which the relative intensities were predicted accurately using the short-time approximation, but the absolute intensities were still overestimated. Although intensities comparable to that obtained with the vibronic theory could be obtained using the short-time approximation, it requires a large damping factor, roughly twice that estimated from the absorption spectrum, to be used in the simulations. Furthermore, we find that DFT underestimates the absolute RRS intensities for R6G as compared to experiments, which is most likely due to the neglect of solvent effects in the calculations. For R6G and FePImCO, vibronic effects are shown to enhance the low-frequency modes relatively more, improving the agreement with experiments.},

The device consists of a tunable 2d ultraviolet laser that illuminates the sample at various wavelengths (210-300 nm) and collects a single Raman spectrum at each laser wavelength. The single spectra are combined to form a two-dimensional spectrum (laser wavelength by scattered wavenumber). In this paper we introduce a novel method for the detection of known agents (‘targets’) within measured 2d spectra. Our method is bases on ‘linear mixed pixel’ techniques from hyperspectral imagery; in particular, we generalize the Adaptive Subspace Detector (ASD) to a form suitable for SWORrD samples. Our detector uses the individual laser runs to define a set of points within wavenumber space; the set of points corresponding to a 2d spectra defines a particular subspace that contains each material. These subspaces are then used with ASD to identify targets. We include experimental results using real-world data to illustrate our results.},

We take advantage of the polarization characteristics of the Raman scattering to reduce the broadband fluorescence background and surface Raman features. Using a custom fiber optic probe with excitation at 785 nm, we have demonstrated real-time polarization analysis.

However, the lack of availability of reasonably high power tunable lasers in the spectral regions where the relevant targets can be interrogated as well as appropriate techniques for high sensitivity, high selectivity detection has hampered the practical exploitation of techniques for the detection of targets important for homeland security and defense applications. Furthermore, emphasis has been on selectivity without particular attention being paid to the impact of interfering species on the quality of detection. Having high sensitivity is necessary but not a sufficient condition. High sensitivity assures a high probability of detection of the target species. However, it is only recently that the sensor community has come to recognize that any measure of probability of detection must be associated with a probability of false alarm, if it is to have any value as a measure of performance. This is especially true when one attempts to compare performance characteristics of different sensors based on different physical principles. In this paper, I will provide a methodology for characterizing the performance of sensors utilizing optical absorption measurement techniques. However, the underlying principles are equally application to all other sensors. While most of the current progress in high sensitivity, high selectivity detection of CWAs, TICs and explosives involve identifying and quantifying the target species in-situ, there is an urgent need for standoff detection of explosives from safe distances. I will describe our results on CO2 and quantum cascade laser (QCL) based photoacoustic sensors for the detection of CWAs, TICs and explosives as well the very new results on stand-off detection of explosives at distances up to 150 meters.

Introduction Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are a common and a growing threat to the civilian society as well as to peace-keeping operations. Today, detection and identification of explosive charges and IEDs in real environments (indoors or outdoors) is a very challenging task and can in many cases also be a very hazardous operation. IEDs are in a way unique compared to regular ordnances, since the IED manufacturer has to improvise the design and use whatever materials are available. For this reason, the threat varies over time and in different parts of the world; it also evolves as countermeasures are taken. The diverse and varying nature of IEDs poses great challenges to the methods for their detection since they can contain any explosive which is available; thismeans commercial, military, or homemade explosives (HMEs). An overview of HME properties is given by Menning and Ostmark [1]. From the perspective of the user of the detection equipment, much would be gained if detection and identification could be},

In particular, density functional methods have evolved to a powerful quantum chemical tool for the determination of the electronic structure of molecules in the last decade. Underlying theoretical concepts for the calculation of intensities are reviewed, emphasizing necessary approximations and formal aspects of the introduced quantities, which are often not explicated in detail in elementary treatments of this topic. It is shown how complex quantum chemistry program packages can be interfaced to new programs in order to calculate IR and Raman spectra. The advantages of numerical differentiation of analytical gradients, dipole moments, and static, as well as dynamic polarizabilities, are pointed out. We carefully investigate the influence of the basis set size on polarizabilities and their spatial derivatives. This leads us to the construction of a hybrid basis set, which is equally well suited for the calculation of vibrational frequencies and Raman intensities.

Conventional nitrocarbon explosive chemicals have very low vapor pressures, and any vapors are easily dispersed in air. Many pointdetection approaches rely on collecting trace solid residues from dust particles or surfaces. Practical approaches for standoff detection are yet to be developed. For the past 5 years, SRI International has been working toward development of a novel scheme for standoff detection of explosive chemicals that uses infrared (IR) laser evaporation of surfacebound explosive followed by ultraviolet (UV) laser photofragmentation of the explosive chemical vapor, and then UV laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) of nitric oxide. This method offers the potential of long standoff range (up to 100 m or more), high sensitivity (vaporized solid), simplicity (no spectrometer or library of reference spectra), and selectivity (only nitrocompounds).},

@article{Jensen2006a,
abstract = {In this work, we present the first calculation of the resonance Raman scattering (RRS) spectrum of rhodamine 6G (R6G) which is a prototype molecule in surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The calculation is done using a recently developed time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method, which uses a short-time approximation to evaluate the Raman scattering cross section. The normal Raman spectrum calculated with this method is in good agreement with experimental results. The calculated RRS spectrum shows qualitative agreement with SERS results at a wavelength that corresponds to excitation of the S(1) state, but there are significant differences with the measured RRS spectrum at wavelengths that correspond to excitation of the vibronic sideband of S(1). Although the agreement with the experiments is not perfect, the results provide insight into the RRS spectrum of R6G at wavelengths close to the absorption maximum where experiments are hindered due to strong fluorescence. The calculated resonance enhancements are found to be on the order of 10(5). This indicates that a surface enhancement factor of about 10(10) would be required in SERS in order to achieve single-molecule detection of R6G.},

abstract = {We present data on standoff detection of chemicals used in synthesis of homemade explosives (HME) using a compact portable standoff Raman system developed at the University of Hawaii. Data presented in this article show that good quality Raman spectra of various organic and inorganic chemicals, including hazardous chemicals such as ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, potassium perchlorate, sulfur, nitrobenzene, benzene, acetone, and gasoline, can be easily obtained from remote distances with a compact standoff Raman system utilizing only a regular 85 mm Nikon camera lens as collection optics. Raman spectra of various chemicals showing clear Raman fingerprints obtained from targets placed at 50 m distance in daylight with 1 to 10 second of integration time are presented in this article. A frequencydoubled mini Nd:YAG pulsed laser source (532 nm, 30 mJ/pulse, 20 Hz, pulse width 8 ns) is used in an oblique geometry to excite the target located at 50 m distance. The standoff Raman system uses a compact spectrograph of size 10 cm (length) x 8.2 cm (width) x 5.2 cm (height) with spectral coverage from 100 to 4500 cm-1 Stokes-Raman shifted from 532 nm laser excitation and is equipped with a gated thermo-electrically cooled ICCD detector. The system is capable of detecting both the target as well as the atmospheric gases before the target. Various chemicals could be easily identified through glass, plastic, and water media. Possible applications of the standoff Raman system for homeland security and environmental monitoring are discussed},
